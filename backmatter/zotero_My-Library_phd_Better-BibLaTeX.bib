  abstract = {The 1000 Genomes Project set out to provide a comprehensive description of common human genetic variation by applying whole-genome sequencing to a diverse set of individuals from multiple populations. Here we report completion of the project, having reconstructed the genomes of 2,504 individuals from 26 populations using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, deep exome sequencing, and dense microarray genotyping. We characterized a broad spectrum of genetic variation, in total over 88 million variants (84.7 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), 3.6 million short insertions/deletions (indels), and 60,000 structural variants), all phased onto high-quality haplotypes. This resource includes {$>$}99\% of SNP variants with a frequency of {$>$}1\% for a variety of ancestries. We describe the distribution of genetic variation across the global sample, and discuss the implications for common disease studies.},

  abstract = {Background: In order to better understand complex diseases, it is important to understand how genetic variation in the regulatory regions affects gene expression. Genetic variants found in these regulatory regions have been shown to activate transcription in a tissue-specific manner. Therefore, it is important to map the aforementioned expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) using a statistically disciplined approach that jointly models all the tissues and makes use of all the information available to maximize the power of eQTL mapping. In this context, we are proposing a score test-based approach where we model tissue-specificity as a random effect and investigate an overall shift in the gene expression combined with tissue-specific effects due to genetic variants. Results: Our approach has 1) a distinct computational edge, and 2) comparable performance in terms of statistical power over other currently existing joint modeling approaches such as MetaTissue eQTL and eQTL-BMA. Using simulations, we show that our method increases the power to detect eQTLs when compared to a tissue-by-tissue approach and can exceed the performance, in terms of computational speed, of MetaTissue eQTL and eQTL-BMA. We apply our method to two publicly available expression datasets from normal human brains, one comprised of four brain regions from 150 neuropathologically normal samples and another comprised of ten brain regions from 134 neuropathologically normal samples, and show that by using our method and jointly analyzing multiple brain regions, we identify eQTLs within more genes when compared to three often used existing methods. Conclusions: Since we employ a score test-based approach, there is no need for parameter estimation under the alternative hypothesis. As a result, model parameters only have to be estimated once per genome, significantly decreasing computation time. Our method also accommodates the analysis of next- generation sequencing data. As an example, by modeling gene transcripts in an analogous fashion to tissues in our current formulation one would be able to test for both a variant overall effect across all isoforms of a gene as well as transcript-specific effects. We implement our approach within the R package JAGUAR, which is now available at the Comprehensive R Archive Network repository.},

  abstract = {DNA sequence variation causes changes in gene expression, which in turn has profound effects on cellular states. These variations affect tissue development and may ultimately lead to pathological phenotypes. A genetic locus containing a sequence variation that affects gene expression is called an ‘‘expression quantitative trait locus’’ (eQTL). Whereas the impact of cellular context on expression levels in general is well established, a lot less is known about the cell-state specificity of eQTL. Previous studies differed with respect to how ‘‘dynamic eQTL’’ were defined. Here, we propose a unified framework distinguishing static, conditional and dynamic eQTL and suggest strategies for mapping these eQTL classes. Further, we introduce a new approach to simultaneously infer eQTL from different cell types. By using murine mRNA expression data from four stages of hematopoiesis and 14 related cellular traits, we demonstrate that static, conditional and dynamic eQTL, although derived from the same expression data, represent functionally distinct types of eQTL. While static eQTL affect generic cellular processes, non-static eQTL are more often involved in hematopoiesis and immune response. Our analysis revealed substantial effects of individual genetic variation on cell type-specific expression regulation. Among a total number of 3,941 eQTL we detected 2,729 static eQTL, 1,187 eQTL were conditionally active in one or several cell types, and 70 eQTL affected expression changes during cell type transitions. We also found evidence for feedback control mechanisms reverting the effect of an eQTL specifically in certain cell types. Loci correlated with hematological traits were enriched for conditional eQTL, thus, demonstrating the importance of conditional eQTL for understanding molecular mechanisms underlying physiological trait variation. The classification proposed here has the potential to streamline and unify future analysis of conditional and dynamic eQTL as well as many other kinds of QTL data.},

  abstract = {Crohn’s disease (CD) accounts for a variety of clinical manifestations or phenotypes that stem from chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Its worldwide incidence is increasing including younger or childhood-onset of disease. The natural history of Crohn’s disease is characterized by a remitting and relapsing course that progresses to complications and surgery in most patients. The goals of treatment are to achieve clinical and endoscopic remission, to avoid disease progression and minimise surgical resections. Medical treatment usually features antibiotics, corticosteroids, immunomodulators (thiopurines, methotrexate). Anti-TNF (tumour necrosis factor) therapy was approved for use in Crohn’s disease in 1998, and has changed the paradigm of treatment, leading to improved rates of response and remission in patients. There are significant considerations that need to be borne in mind, when treating patients including immunogenicity, safety profile and duration of treatment.},

We used a systems biology approach to comprehensively assess the impact of environmental and genetic factors on immune cell populations in peripheral blood, including associations with immunoglobulin concentrations, from \$500 healthy volunteers from the Human Functional Genomics Project. Genetic heritability estimation showed that variations in T cell numbers are more strongly driven by genetic factors, while B cell counts are more environmentally influenced. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping identified eight independent genomic loci associated with leukocyte count variation, including four associations with T and B cell subtypes. The QTLs identified were enriched among genome-wide association study (GWAS) SNPs reported to increase susceptibility to immune-mediated diseases. Our systems approach provides insights into cellular and humoral immune trait variability in humans.},

  abstract = {IBD, comprising Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, is a chronic immunologically mediated disease at the intersection of complex interactions between genetics, environment and gut microbiota. Established high-prevalence populations of IBD in North America and Europe experienced the steepest increase in incidence towards the second half of the twentieth century. Furthermore, populations previously considered ‘low risk’ (such as in Japan and India) are witnessing an increase in incidence. Potentially relevant environmental influences span the spectrum of life from mode of childbirth and early-life exposures (including breastfeeding and antibiotic exposure in infancy) to exposures later on in adulthood (including smoking, major life stressors, diet and lifestyle). Data support an association between smoking and Crohn’s disease whereas smoking cessation, but not current smoking, is associated with an increased risk of ulcerative colitis. Dietary fibre (particularly fruits and vegetables), saturated fats, depression and impaired sleep, and low vitamin D levels have all been associated with incident IBD. Interventional studies assessing the effects of modifying these risk factors on natural history and patient outcomes are an important unmet need. In this Review, the changing epidemiology of IBD, mechanisms behind various environmental associations and interventional studies to modify risk factors and disease course are discussed.},

There are often many possibilities, including restricted permutation or permutation of some form of residuals. This paper provides a summary of recent empirical and theoretical results concerning available methods and gives recommendations for their use in univariate and multivariate applications. The focus of the paper is on complex designs in analysis of variance and multiple regression (i.e., linear models). The assumption of exchangeability required for a permutation test is assured by random allocation of treatments to units in experimental work. For observational data, exchangeability is tantamount to the assumption of independent and identically distributed errors under a null hypothesis. For partial regression, the method of permutation of residuals under a reduced model has been shown to provide the best test. For analysis of variance, one must first identify exchangeable units by considering expected mean squares. Then, one may generally produce either (i) an exact test by restricting permutations or (ii) an approximate test by permuting raw data or some form of residuals. The latter can provide a more powerful test in many situations.},

Steps needed to detect and establish a disease association using case-control data are not discussed here.

  abstract = {Background and aims: Infliximab is an effective treatment for ulcerative colitis with over 60\% of patients responding to treatment and up to 30\% reaching remission. The mechanism of resistance to anti-tumour necrosis factor a (anti-TNFa) is unknown. This study used colonic mucosal gene expression to provide a predictive response signature for infliximab treatment in ulcerative colitis. Methods: Two cohorts of patients who received their first treatment with infliximab for refractory ulcerative colitis were studied. Response to infliximab was defined as endoscopic and histological healing. Total RNA from pre-treatment colonic mucosal biopsies was analysed with Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to confirm microarray data. Results: For predicting response to infliximab treatment, pre-treatment colonic mucosal expression profiles were compared for responders and non-responders. Comparative analysis identified 179 differentially expressed probe sets in cohort A and 361 in cohort B with an overlap of 74 probe sets, representing 53 known genes, between both analyses. Comparative analysis of both cohorts combined, yielded 212 differentially expressed probe sets. The top five differentially expressed genes in a combined analysis of both cohorts were osteoprotegerin, stanniocalcin-1, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, interleukin 13 receptor alpha 2 and interleukin 11. All proteins encoded by these genes are involved in the adaptive immune response. These markers separated responders from non-responders with 95\% sensitivity and 85\% specificity. Conclusion: Gene array studies of ulcerative colitis mucosal biopsies identified predictive panels of genes for (non-)response to infliximab. Further study of the pathways involved should allow a better understanding of the mechanisms of resistance to infliximab therapy in ulcerative colitis. ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00639821.},

  abstract = {Antibodies are highly functional glycoproteins capable of providing immune protection through multiple mechanisms, including direct pathogen neutralization and the engagement of their Fc portions with surrounding effector immune cells that induce anti-pathogenic responses. Small modifications to multiple antibody biophysical features induced by vaccines can significantly alter functional immune outcomes, though it is difficult to predict which combinations confer protective immunity. In order to give insight into the highly complex and dynamic processes that drive an effective humoral immune response, here we discuss recent applications of ‘Systems Serology’, a new approach that uses data-driven (also called ‘machine learning’) computational analysis and high-throughput experimental data to infer networks of important antibody features associated with protective humoral immunity and/or Fc functional activity. This approach offers the ability to understand humoral immunity beyond single correlates of protection, assessing the relative importance of multiple biophysical modifications to antibody features with multivariate computational approaches. Systems Serology has the exciting potential to help identify novel correlates of protection from infection and may generate a more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms behind protection, including key relationships between specific Fc functions and antibody biophysical features (e.g. antigen recognition, isotype, subclass and/or glycosylation events). Reviewed here are some of the experimental and computational technologies available for Systems Serology research and evidence that the application has broad relevance to multiple different infectious diseases including viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites.},

  abstract = {We review the problem of confounding in genetic association studies, which arises principally because of population structure and cryptic relatedness. Many treatments of the problem consider only a simple “island” model of population structure. We take a broader approach, which views population structure and cryptic relatedness as different aspects of a single confounder: the unobserved pedigree defining the (often distant) relationships among the study subjects. Kinship is therefore a central concept, and we review methods of defining and estimating kinship coefficients, both pedigreebased and marker-based. In this unified framework we review solutions to the problem of population structure, including family-based study designs, genomic control, structured association, regression control, principal components adjustment and linear mixed models. The last solution makes the most explicit use of the kinships among the study subjects, and has an established role in the analysis of animal and plant breeding studies. Recent computational developments mean that analyses of human genetic association data are beginning to benefit from its powerful tests for association, which protect against population structure and cryptic kinship, as well as intermediate levels of confounding by the pedigree.},

One important example is the IGHV1-69 germline gene where the biased use of alleles that encode the critical CDR-H2 Phe54 (F-alleles) to make broadly neutralizing antibodies (HV1-69-sBnAb) to the influenza A hemagglutinin stem domain has been clearly established. However, whether IGHV1-69 polymorphism can also modulate B cell function and Ab repertoire expression through promoter and copy number (CN) variations has not been reported, nor has whether IGHV1-69 allelic distribution is impacted by ethnicity. Here we studied a cohort of NIH H5N1 vaccinees and demonstrate for the first time the influence of IGHV1-69 polymorphism on V-segment usage, somatic hypermutation and B cell expansion that elucidates the dominance of F-alleles in HV1-69-sBnAbs. We provide evidence that Phe54/Leu54 (F/L) polymorphism correlates with shifted repertoire usage of other IGHV germline genes. In addition, we analyzed ethnically diverse individuals within the 1000 genomes project and discovered marked variations in F- and L- genotypes and CN among the various ethnic groups that may impact HV1-69-sBnAb responses. These results have immediate implications for understanding HV1-69-sBnAb responses at the individual and population level and for the design and implementation of "universal" influenza vaccine.},

  abstract = {Background: RNA-Sequencing analysis methods are rapidly evolving, and the tool choice for each step of one common workflow, differential expression analysis, which includes read alignment, expression modeling, and differentially expressed gene identification, has a dramatic impact on performance characteristics. Although a number of workflows are emerging as high performers that are robust to diverse input types, the relative performance characteristics of these workflows when either read depth or sample number is limited–a common occurrence in real-world practice–remain unexplored. Results: Here, we evaluate the impact of varying read depth and sample number on the performance of differential gene expression identification workflows, as measured by precision, or the fraction of genes correctly identified as differentially expressed, and by recall, or the fraction of differentially expressed genes identified. We focus our analysis on 30 high-performing workflows, systematically varying the read depth and number of biological replicates of patient monocyte samples provided as input. We find that, in general for most workflows, read depth has little effect on workflow performance when held above two million reads per sample, with reduced workflow performance below this threshold. The greatest impact of decreased sample number is seen below seven samples per group, when more heterogeneity in workflow performance is observed. The choice of differential expression identification tool, in particular, has a large impact on the response to limited inputs. Conclusions: Among the tested workflows, the recall/precision balance remains relatively stable at a range of read depths and sample numbers, although some workflows are more sensitive to input restriction. At ranges typically recommended for biological studies, performance is more greatly impacted by the number of biological replicates than by read depth. Caution should be used when selecting analysis workflows and interpreting results from low sample number experiments, as all workflows exhibit poorer performance at lower sample numbers near typically reported values, with variable impact on recall versus precision. These analyses highlight the performance characteristics of common differential gene expression workflows at varying read depths and sample numbers, and provide empirical guidance in experimental and analytical design.},

Nearly all clinically measured hematopoietic traits exhibit extensive variation and are highly heritable, underscoring the importance of genetic variation in these processes. This review explores how human genetics have illuminated our understanding of hematopoiesis in health and disease. The study of rare mutations in blood and immune disorders has elucidated novel roles for regulators of hematopoiesis and uncovered numerous important molecular pathways, as seen through examples such as DiamondBlackfan anemia and the GATA2 deficiency syndromes. Additionally, population studies of common genetic variation have revealed mechanisms by which human hematopoiesis can be modulated. We discuss advances in functionally characterizing common variants associated with blood cell traits and discuss therapeutic insights, such as the discovery of BCL11A as a modulator of fetal hemoglobin expression. Finally, as genetic techniques continue to evolve, we discuss the prospects, challenges, and unanswered questions that lie ahead in this burgeoning field.},

  abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models (LMEMs) have become increasingly prominent in psycholinguistics and related areas. However, many researchers do not seem to appreciate how random effects structures affect the generalizability of an analysis. Here, we argue that researchers using LMEMs for confirmatory hypothesis testing should minimally adhere to the standards that have been in place for many decades. Through theoretical arguments and Monte Carlo simulation, we show that LMEMs generalize best when they include the maximal random effects structure justified by the design. The generalization performance of LMEMs including data-driven random effects structures strongly depends upon modeling criteria and sample size, yielding reasonable results on moderately-sized samples when conservative criteria are used, but with little or no power advantage over maximal models. Finally, random-intercepts-only LMEMs used on within-subjects and/or within-items data from populations where subjects and/or items vary in their sensitivity to experimental manipulations always generalize worse than separate F1 and F2 tests, and in many cases, even worse than F1 alone. Maximal LMEMs should be the ‘gold standard’ for confirmatory hypothesis testing in psycholinguistics and beyond.},

Software offering the integrated analysis of data from different technologies is of growing importance as new data emerge in systems biology studies. MAYDAY is an extensible platform for visual data exploration and interactive analysis and provides many methods for dissecting complex transcriptome datasets. We present MAYDAY SEASIGHT, an extension that allows to integrate data from different platforms such as deep sequencing and microarrays.

  abstract = {Background: Failure of anti-TNF treatment in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients can take on several forms, each posing distinct etio-pathogenic considerations and management dilemmas. Aim: The aim of this study is to review the mechanisms responsible for the various forms of anti-TNF failures in IBD and to elucidate strategies for optimizing clinical efficacy. Results: Primary failures of anti-TNF induction therapy occur in up to 40\% of patients in clinical trials and in 10–20\% in clinical series. Longer disease duration, smoking and several genetic mutations are predisposing factors for primary failures. Curiously, primary non-response is probably not a class-effect phenomenon since switching to another anti-TNF is effective in over 50\% of such patients. Secondary loss of response is also a common clinical problem with incidence ranging between 23 and 46\% at 12 months after anti-TNF initiation. Underlying mechanisms are often related to increased anti-TNF clearance by anti-drug antibodies, but may also include other causes for recalcitrant IBD activity as well as disorders that are unrelated to IBD itself. Astute management begins with verifying the presence of uncontrolled inflammatory IBD activity as a cause for patient's symptoms. Next, it is prudent to consider a trial of wait-and-see approach, since in some patients with mild-moderate symptoms, loss of response may resolve without alteration of therapy. If it does not, measuring anti-TNF trough levels and anti-drug antibodies may clarify the underlying mechanism in individual patients although there are still limited and conflicting data regarding the role of these measurements in guiding the choice between dose-intensification, switch to another anti-TNF or to another immunomodulator, and the addition of an immuno-modulator as a combination therapy with the failing anti-TNF. Anti-TNF re-induction after prior drug-holiday is a distinct clinical scenario and scarce evidence suggests re-induction outcome to be dependent on the circumstances when drug-holiday was commenced. Finally, discontinuation of anti-TNF in patients with stable deep clinico-biologic and mucosal remission may be a viable option, as in these carefully selected patients the majority may enjoy long-term remission without the need for continued anti-TNF treatment.},

  abstract = {Objective We have previously described a prognostic transcriptional signature in CD8 T cells that separates inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients into 2 phenotypically-distinct subgroups, which we termed IBD1 and IBD2. Here we sought to develop a blood-based prognostic test that could identify these patient subgroups without the need for cell separation, and thus be suitable for routine clinical use in Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Design Patients with active IBD were recruited before treatment. Transcriptomic analyses were performed on purified CD8 T cells and/or whole blood. Detailed phenotype information was collected prospectively. IBD1/IBD2 patient subgroups were identified by consensus clustering of CD8 T cell transcriptomes. In a training cohort, statistical (machine) learning was used to identify groups of genes (“classifiers”) whose differential expression in whole blood re-created the IBD1/IBD2 patient subgroups. Genes from the best classifiers were qPCR-optimised, and further statistical learning was applied to the qPCR dataset to identify the optimal classifier, which was locked-down for further testing. Independent validation was sought in separate cohorts of CD (n=66) and UC patients (n=57). Results In both independent validation cohorts, a 17-gene qPCR-based classifier stratified patients into two distinct subgroups. Irrespective of the underlying diagnosis, IBDhi patients (analogous to the poor prognosis IBD1 subgroup) experienced significantly more aggressive disease than IBDlo patients (analogous to IBD2), with earlier need for treatment escalation and more escalations over time. Conclusion This is the first validated prognostic biomarker that can predict prognosis in newly-diagnosed IBD patients, and represents a step towards personalised therapy.},

  abstract = {The innate immune system is critical for early detection of invading viruses and for initiating cellular host defense countermeasures, which include the production of interferons. Ankyrin repeat domain 22 (ANKRD22) encodes a protein of 191 amino acids containing 2 ankyrin repeating domain, and its biological function was unknown. In this study, we find that ANKRD22 expression can be significantly induced in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by DNA virus herpes simplex virus -1(HSV-1) and RNA virus respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) as well as IFN-α and IFN-γ. Its induction in PBMCs by viruses is largely a secondary effect of virus-induced interferons. We further demonstrate that ANKRD22 was majorly induced in monocytes and dendritic cells from PBMCs. Over-expression of ANKRD22 confers protection against HSV-1 and RSV infection in multiple tested cell lines. Vice versa, inhibition of ANKRD22 leads to enhanced HSV-1 and RSV replication in host cells. Furthermore, we identifies that ANKRD22 specifically interacts with STING, a critical protein function in multiple antiviral innate immune pathways. ANKRD22 by itself can only slightly induce type I IFNs IFN-α and IFN-β, and can’t induce type III IFN IL-29. However, it significantly synergizes STING-induced both type I and type III interferon production. Collectively, our studies indicate that ANKRD22 plays an important role for host defense against both DNA and RNA viruses by optimizing STING’s function on inducing type I and type III IFNs.},

  abstract = {Functional mechanisms remain unknown for most genetic loci associated to complex human traits and diseases. In this study, we first mapped trans-eQTLs in a data set of primary monocytes stimulated with LPS, and discovered that a risk variant for autoimmune disease, rs17622517 in an intron of C5ORF56, affects the expression of the transcription factor IRF1 20 kb away. The cis-regulatory effect on IRF1 is active under early immune stimulus, with a large number of trans-eQTL effects across the genome under late LPS response. Using CRISPRi silencing, we showed that the SNP locus indeed functions as an IRF1 enhancer with widespread transcriptional effects. Genome editing by CRISPR further indicated that rs17622517 is indeed a causal variant in this locus, and recapitulated the LPS-specific trans-eQTL signal. Our results suggest that this common genetic variant affects inter-individual response to immune stimuli via regulation of IRF1. For this autoimmune GWAS locus, our work provides evidence of the causal variant, demonstrates a condition-specific enhancer effect, identifies IRF1 as the likely causal gene in cis, and indicates that overactivation of the downstream immune-related pathway may be the cellular mechanism increasing disease risk. This work not only provides rare experimental validation of a master-regulatory trans-eQTL, but also demonstrates the power of eQTL mapping to build mechanistic hypotheses amenable for experimental follow-up using the CRISPR toolkit.},

  abstract = {One of the main objectives in the analysis of microarray experiments is the identification of genes that are differentially expressed under two experimental conditions. This task is complicated by the noisiness of the data and the large number of genes that are examined simultaneously. Here, we present a novel technique for identifying differentially expressed genes that does not originate from a sophisticated statistical model but rather from an analysis of biological reasoning. The new technique, which is based on calculating rank products (RP) from replicate experiments, is fast and simple. At the same time, it provides a straightforward and statistically stringent way to determine the significance level for each gene and allows for the flexible control of the false-detection rate and familywise error rate in the multiple testing situation of a microarray experiment. We use the RP technique on three biological data sets and show that in each case it performs more reliably and consistently than the non-parametric t-test variant implemented in Tusher et al.’s significance analysis of microarrays (SAM). We also show that the RP results are reliable in highly noisy data. An analysis of the physiological function of the identified genes indicates that the RP approach is powerful for identifying biologically relevant expression changes. In addition, using RP can lead to a sharp reduction in the number of replicate experiments needed to obtain reproducible results.},

To assess the relative contribution of heritable versus non-heritable factors, we have performed a systems-level analysis of 210 healthy twins between 8 and 82 years of age. We measured 204 different parameters, including cell population frequencies, cytokine responses, and serum proteins, and found that 77\% of these are dominated ({$>$}50\% of variance) and 58\% almost completely determined ({$>$}80\% of variance) by nonheritable influences. In addition, some of these parameters become more variable with age, suggesting the cumulative influence of environmental exposure. Similarly, the serological responses to seasonal influenza vaccination are also determined largely by nonheritable factors, likely due to repeated exposure to different strains. Lastly, in MZ twins discordant for cytomegalovirus infection, more than half of all parameters are affected. These results highlight the largely reactive and adaptive nature of the immune system in healthy individuals.},

Human immune systems vary as a consequence of heritable and non-heritable influences, but symbiotic and pathogenic microbes and other non-heritable influences explain most of this variation.

  abstract = {Genetic variants in cis-regulatory elements or trans-acting regulators frequently influence the quantity and spatiotemporal distribution of gene transcription. Recent interest in expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping has paralleled the adoption of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for the analysis of complex traits and disease in humans. Under the hypothesis that many GWAS associations tag non-coding SNPs with small effects, and that these SNPs exert phenotypic control by modifying gene expression, it has become common to interpret GWAS associations using eQTL data. To fully exploit the mechanistic interpretability of eQTL-GWAS comparisons, an improved understanding of the genetic architecture and causal mechanisms of cell type specificity of eQTLs is required. We address this need by performing an eQTL analysis in three parts: first we identified eQTLs from eleven studies on seven cell types; then we integrated eQTL data with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data from the ENCODE project; finally we built a set of classifiers to predict the cell type specificity of eQTLs. The cell type specificity of eQTLs is associated with eQTL SNP overlap with hundreds of cell type specific CRE classes, including enhancer, promoter, and repressive chromatin marks, regions of open chromatin, and many classes of DNA binding proteins. These associations provide insight into the molecular mechanisms generating the cell type specificity of eQTLs and the mode of regulation of corresponding eQTLs. Using a random forest classifier with cell specific CRE-SNP overlap as features, we demonstrate the feasibility of predicting the cell type specificity of eQTLs. We then demonstrate that CREs from a trait-associated cell type can be used to annotate GWAS associations in the absence of eQTL data for that cell type. We anticipate that such integrative, predictive modeling of cell specificity will improve our ability to understand the mechanistic basis of human complex phenotypic variation.},

Investigating the function of the SCN has often focused on the identification of rhythmically expressed genes. However, not all genes critical for SCN function are rhythmically expressed. An alternative strategy is to characterize those genes that are selectively enriched in the SCN. Here, we examined the transcriptome of the SCN and whole brain (WB) of mice using meta-analysis of publicly deposited data across a range of microarray platforms and RNASeq data. A total of 79 microarrays were used (24 SCN and 55 WB samples, 4 different microarray platforms), alongside 17 RNA-Seq data files (7 SCN and 10 WB). 31 684 MGI gene symbols had data for at least one platform. Meta-analysis using a random effects model for weighting individual effect sizes (derived from differential expression between relevant SCN and WB samples) reliably detected known SCN markers. SCN-enriched transcripts identified in this study provide novel insights into SCN function, including identifying genes which may play key roles in SCN physiology or provide SCN-specific drivers.},

The late vaccine response showed a transcriptional pattern suggestive of increased protein biosynthesis and cellular proliferation. Integrative analyses revealed a 494-gene expression signature--including STAT1, CD74, and E2F2--which strongly correlates with the magnitude of the antibody response. High vaccine responder status correlates with increased early expression of interferon signaling and antigen processing and presentation genes.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the role of a systems biology approach in understanding the molecular events that take place in vivo after influenza vaccination and in the development of better predictors of vaccine responsiveness.},

In an external cohort of 131 patients, increasing tertiles of PNR genetic risk score correlated with increased risk of PNR (P = 0.052). Twelve candidate loci were associated with DR. Genetic risk score quartiles for DR demonstrated a strong dose-response relationship in predicting treatment duration. Genetic risk scores for PNR and DR were not associated with infliximab levels or antibody formation. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} Genetic polymorphisms enhance prediction of PNR and DR to anti-TNF therapy in patients with UC.},

Using simulations, we compare the finite-sample properties of a few often-used permutation tests and the parametric bootstrap. We consider interactions of an exposure with single and multiple polymorphisms. Finally, we address when permutation tests of interaction will be approximately valid in large samples for specific test statistics.},

  abstract = {The factors regulating the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), a ubiquitous family of ∼22-nt noncoding regulatory RNAs, remain undefined. However, it is known that miRNAs are first transcribed as a largely unstructured precursor, termed a primary miRNA (pri-miRNA), which is sequentially processed in the nucleus, to give the ∼65-nt pre-miRNA hairpin intermediate, and then in the cytoplasm, to give the mature miRNA. Here we have sought to identify the RNA polymerase responsible for miRNA transcription and to define the structure of a full-length human miRNA. We show that the pri-miRNA precursors for nine human miRNAs are both capped and polyadenylated and report the sequence of the full-length, ∼3433-nt pri-miR-21 RNA. This pri-miR-21 gene sequence is flanked 5؅ by a promoter element able to transcribe heterologous mRNAs and 3؅ by a consensus polyadenylation sequence. Nuclear processing of pri-miRNAs was found to be efficient, thus largely preventing the nuclear export of full-length pri-miRNAs. Nevertheless, an intact miRNA stem–loop precursor located in the 3؅ UTR of a protein coding gene only moderately inhibited expression of the linked open reading frame, probably because the 3؅ truncated mRNA could still be exported and expressed. Together, these data show that human pri-miRNAs are not only structurally similar to mRNAs but can, in fact, function both as pri-miRNAs and mRNAs.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully mapped thousands of loci associated with complex traits. These associations could reveal the molecular mechanisms altered in common complex diseases and result in the identification of novel drug targets. However, GWAS have also left a number of outstanding questions. In particular, the majority of disease-associated loci lie in non-coding regions of the genome and, even though they are thought to play a role in gene expression regulation, it is unclear which genes they regulate and in which cell types or physiological contexts this regulation occurs. This has hindered the translation of GWAS findings into clinical interventions. In this review we summarize how these challenges have been addressed over the last decade, with a particular focus on the integration of GWAS results with functional genomics datasets. Firstly, we investigate how the tissues and cell types involved in diseases can be identified using methods that test for enrichment of GWAS variants in genomic annotations. Secondly, we explore how to find the genes regulated by GWAS loci using methods that test for colocalization of GWAS signals with molecular phenotypes such as quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Finally, we highlight potential future research avenues such as integrating GWAS results with single-cell sequencing readouts, designing functionally informed polygenic risk scores (PRS), and validating disease associated genes using genetic engineering. These tools will be crucial to identify new drug targets for common complex diseases.},

Antibody titers against the 3 vaccine strains (H1N1, H3N2, and B) were significantly higher in the TIV group and correlated with number of antibody-secreting cells. Both vaccines induced overexpression of interferon (IFN)-signaling genes but with different kinetics. TIV induced expression of IFN genes on day 1 after vaccination in all age groups, and LAIV induced expression of IFN genes on day 7 after vaccination but only in children {$<$}5 years old. IFN-related genes overexpressed in both vaccinated groups correlated with H3N2 antibody titers.\textbackslash n\textbackslash nCONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that LAIV and TIV induced significantly different B-cell responses in vaccinated children. Early induction of IFN appears to be important for development of antibody responses.},

Overcoming these obstacles will require great investment and also time, therefore more effective vaccines should be developed to meet the needs of those who would benefit the most from them. Increasing our current knowledge of mucosal immunity, response to Rotavirus infection and its modulation by circadian rhythms could point at actionable pathways to improve vaccination efficacy, especially in the case of individuals affected by environmental enteropathy. Also, a better understanding and validation of Rotavirus entry factors as well as the systematic monitoring of dominant strains could assist in tailoring vaccines to individual’s needs. Another aspect that could improve vaccine efficiency is targeting to M cells, for which new ligands could potentially be sought. Finally, alternative mucosal adjuvants and vaccine expression, storage and delivery systems could have a positive impact in the outcome of Rotavirus vaccination.},

  abstract = {The analysis of patient blood transcriptional profiles offers a means to investigate the immunological mechanisms relevant to human diseases on a genome-wide scale. In addition, such studies provide a basis for the discovery of clinically relevant biomarker signatures. We designed a strategy for microarray analysis that is based on the identification of transcriptional modules formed by genes coordinately expressed in multiple disease data sets. Mapping changes in gene expression at the module level generated disease-specific transcriptional fingerprints that provide a stable framework for the visualization and functional interpretation of microarray data. These transcriptional modules were used as a basis for the selection of biomarkers and the development of a multivariate transcriptional indicator of disease progression in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. Thus, this work describes the implementation and application of a methodology designed to support systems-scale analysis of the human immune system in translational research settings. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The expression microarray is a frequently used approach to study gene expression on a genome-wide scale. However, the data produced by the thousands of microarray studies published annually are confounded by ‘‘batch effects,’’ the systematic error introduced when samples are processed in multiple batches. Although batch effects can be reduced by careful experimental design, they cannot be eliminated unless the whole study is done in a single batch. A number of programs are now available to adjust microarray data for batch effects prior to analysis. We systematically evaluated six of these programs using multiple measures of precision, accuracy and overall performance. ComBat, an Empirical Bayes method, outperformed the other five programs by most metrics. We also showed that it is essential to standardize expression data at the probe level when testing for correlation of expression profiles, due to a sizeable probe effect in microarray data that can inflate the correlation among replicates and unrelated samples.},

We carried out high-resolution genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptomic profiling in three major human immune cell types (CD14+ monocytes, CD16+ neutrophils, and naive CD4+ T cells) from up to 197 individuals. We assess, quantitatively, the relative contribution of cis-genetic and epigenetic factors to transcription and evaluate their impact as potential sources of confounding in epigenome-wide association studies. Further, we characterize highly coordinated genetic effects on gene expression, methylation, and histone variation through quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and allele-specific (AS) analyses. Finally, we demonstrate colocalization of molecular trait QTLs at 345 unique immune disease loci. This expansive, high-resolution atlas of multiomics changes yields insights into cell-type-specific correlation between diverse genomic inputs, more generalizable correlations between these inputs, and defines molecular events that may underpin complex disease risk.},

Among a range of applications, PRS are commonly used to assess shared aetiology among different phenotypes and to evaluate the predictive power of genetic data, while they are also now being exploited as part of study design, in which experiments are performed on individuals, or their biological samples (eg. tissues, cells), at the tails of the PRS distribution and contrasted. As GWAS sample sizes increase and PRS become more powerful, they are also set to play a key role in personalised medicine. Despite their growing application and importance, there are limited guidelines for performing PRS analyses, which can lead to inconsistency between studies and misinterpretation of results. Here we provide detailed guidelines for performing polygenic risk score analyses relevant to different methods for their calculation, outlining standard quality control steps and offering recommendations for best-practice. We also discuss different methods for the calculation of PRS, common misconceptions regarding the interpretation of results and future challenges.},

Our approach involves integrating cell type-specific expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data and TF data from chromatin immunoprecipitationto-tag-sequencing (ChIP-seq) experiments in cell lines. To test the method, we used eQTL data from human monocytes in order to screen for TFs. Using a list of known monocyte-regulating TFs, we tested the hypothesis that the binding sites of cell type-specific TF regulators would be concentrated in the vicinity of monocyte eQTLs. For each of 397 ChIP-seq data sets, we obtained an enrichment ratio for the number of ChIP-seq peaks that are located within monocyte eQTLs. We ranked ChIP-seq data sets according to their statistical significances for eQTL overlap, and from this ranking, we observed that monocyte-regulating TFs are more highly ranked than would be expected by chance. We identified 27 TFs that had significant monocyte enrichment scores and mapped them into a protein interaction network. Our analysis uncovered two novel candidate monocyte-regulating TFs, BCLAF1 and SIN3A. Our approach is an efficient method to identify candidate TFs that can be used for any cell/tissue type for which eQTL data are available.},

This problem poses significant challenges due to high dimensionality of both the gene expression and the genomic marker data. We propose a multivariate response regression approach with simultaneous variable selection and dimension reduction for the eQTL mapping problem. Transcripts with similar expression are clustered into groups, and their expression profiles are viewed as a multivariate response. Then, we employ our recently developed sparse partial least-squares regression methodology to select markers associated with each cluster of genes. We demonstrate with extensive simulations that our eQTL mapping with multivariate response sparse partial least-squares regression (M-SPLS eQTL) method overcomes the issue of multiple transcript- or marker-specific analyses, thereby avoiding potential elevation of type I error. Additionally, joint analysis of multiple transcripts by multivariate response regression increases power for detecting weak linkages. We illustrate that M-SPLS eQTL compares competitively with other approaches and has a number of significant advantages, including the ability to handle highly correlated genotype data and computational efficiency. We provide an application of this methodology to a mouse data set concerning obesity and diabetes.},

  abstract = {Group-level variance estimates of zero often arise when fitting multilevel or hierarchical linear models, especially when the number of groups is small. For situations where zero variances are implausible a priori, we propose a maximum penalized likelihood approach to avoid such boundary estimates. This approach is equivalent to estimating variance parameters by their posterior mode, given a weakly informative prior distribution. By choosing the penalty from the log-gamma family with shape parameter greater than 1, we ensure that the estimated variance will be positive. We suggest a default log-gamma(2, λ) penalty with λ → 0, which ensures that the maximum penalized likelihood estimate is approximately one standard error from zero when the maximum likelihood estimate is zero, thus remaining consistent with the data while being nondegenerate. We also show that the maximum penalized likelihood estimator with this default penalty is a good approximation to the posterior median obtained under a noninformative prior. Our default method provides better estimates of model parameters and standard errors than the maximum likelihood or the restricted maximum likelihood estimators. The log-gamma family can also be used to convey substantive prior information. In either case—pure penalization or prior information—our recommended procedure gives nondegenerate estimates and in the limit coincides with maximum likelihood as the number of groups increases.},

The problem arises when the addition of a variable to a regression equation produces an unintended discrepancy between the regression coefficient and the effect that the coefficient is expected to represent. Avoiding such discrepancies presents a challenge not only to practitioners of econometrics, but to all analysts in the data intensive sciences. This note describes graphical tools for understanding, visualizing, and resolving the problem through a series of illustrative examples. We have found that the examples presented here can serve as a powerful instructional device to supplement formal discussions of the problem. By making this “crash course” accessible to instructors and practitioners, we hope to avail these tools to a broader community of scientists concerned with the causal interpretation of regression models.},

  abstract = {Background: When using a continuous outcome measure in a randomised controlled trial (RCT), the baseline score should be measured in addition to the post-intervention score, and it should be analysed using the appropriate statistical analysis. Methods: We derive the correlation between the change score and baseline score and show that there is always a correlation (usually negative) between the change score and baseline score. We discuss the following correlations and provide the mathematical derivations in the Appendix:   Correlation between change score and baseline score   Correlation between change score and post score   Correlation between change score and average score. The setting here is a parallel, two-arm RCT, but the method discussed in this paper is applicable for any studies or trials that have a continuous outcome measure; it is not restricted to RCTs. Results: We show that using the change score as the outcome measure does not address the problem of regression to the mean, nor does it take account of the baseline imbalance. Whether the outcome is change score or post score, one should always adjust for baseline using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA); otherwise, the estimated treat effect may be biased. We show that these correlations also apply when comparing two measurement methods using BlandAltman plots. Conclusions: The correlation between baseline and post-intervention scores can be derived using the variance sum law. We can then use the derived correlation to calculate the required sample size in the design stage. Baseline imbalance may occur in RCTs, and ANCOVA should be used to adjust for baseline in the analysis stage.},

  abstract = {(the pneumococcus) is a common nasopharyngeal commensal capable of infecting normally sterile anatomical sites, resulting in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). Effective vaccines preventing IPD exist, but each of the antigens they contain typically induces protective immunity against only one of the approximately 100 pneumococcal serotypes, which are differentiated by immunogenically-distinct polysaccharide capsules. Serotypes vary in their propensity to cause IPD, quantified as their invasiveness. Vaccines are designed to include serotypes commonly isolated from IPD, but the immunity they induce is sufficiently strong to also eliminate vaccine serotypes from carriage. This enables their replacement by non-vaccine serotypes in the nasopharynx. The emergence of invasive non-vaccine serotypes has undermined some vaccination programmes’ benefits. Recent advances in genomics and modeling have enabled forecasting of which non-vaccine serotypes will be successful post-vaccination. Here, we demonstrate that vaccines optimised using this framework can minimise IPD and antibiotic-resistant disease more effectively than existing formulations in the model, through mitigating the consequences of serotype replacement. The simulations also demonstrate that tailoring vaccines to the pre-vaccine bacterial population is likely to have a substantial impact on reducing IPD, highlighting the importance of epidemiological data, genomics and ecological models as tools for vaccine design and evaluation.},

  abstract = {Rotavirus infections are a leading cause of severe, dehydrating gastroenteritis in children {$<$}5 years of age. Despite the global introduction of vaccinations for rotavirus over a decade ago, rotavirus infections still result in {$>$}200,000 deaths annually, mostly in low-income countries. Rotavirus primarily infects enterocytes and induces diarrhoea through the destruction of absorptive enterocytes (leading to malabsorption), intestinal secretion stimulated by rotavirus non-structural protein 4 and activation of the enteric nervous system. In addition, rotavirus infections can lead to antigenaemia (which is associated with more severe manifestations of acute gastroenteritis) and viraemia, and rotavirus can replicate in systemic sites, although this is limited. Reinfections with rotavirus are common throughout life, although the disease severity is reduced with repeat infections. The immune correlates of protection against rotavirus reinfection and recovery from infection are poorly understood, although rotavirus-specific immunoglobulin A has a role in both aspects. The management of rotavirus infection focuses on the prevention and treatment of dehydration, although the use of antiviral and anti-emetic drugs can be indicated in some cases.},

  abstract = {Disease-associated loci identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) frequently localize to non-coding sequence. We and others have demonstrated strong enrichment of such single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), supporting an important role for regulatory genetic variation in complex disease pathogenesis. Herein we describe our initial efforts to develop a predictive model of disease-associated variants leveraging eQTL information. We first catalogued cis-acting eQTLs (SNPs within 100kb of target gene transcripts) by meta-analyzing four studies of three blood-derived tissues (n = 586). At a false discovery rate {$<$} 5\%, we mapped eQTLs for 6,535 genes; these were enriched for disease-associated genes (P {$<$} 10-04), particularly those related to immune diseases and metabolic traits. Based on eQTL information and other variant annotations (distance from target gene transcript, minor allele frequency, and chromatin state), we created multivariate logistic regression models to predict SNP membership in reported GWAS. The complete model revealed independent contributions of specific annotations as strong predictors, including evidence for an eQTL (odds ratio (OR) = 1.2-2.0, P {$<$} 10-11) and the chromatin states of active promoters, different classes of strong or weak enhancers, or transcriptionally active regions (OR = 1.5-2.3, P {$<$} 10-11). This complete prediction model including eQTL association information ultimately allowed for better discrimination of SNPs with higher probabilities of GWAS membership (6.3-10.0\%, compared to 3.5\% for a random SNP) than the other two models excluding eQTL information. This eQTL-based prediction model of disease relevance can help systematically prioritize non-coding GWAS SNPs for further functional characterization.},

In Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis refractory to standard medications, treatment choice among available biologic agents can be challenging. Several parameters should be taken into account to help physicians through the decision-making process, including the comparative effectiveness and long-term safety profile, availability and labelling in the prescriber’s country, international guidelines, and cost, as well as patient preferences (such as the route of administration). Herein, we provide practical insights on the use of biologic agents in IBD. The results of head-to-head trials between biologic agents are eagerly awaited to guide decisionmaking regarding the choice of first-line biologic agents and to determine whether switching within the same drug class or swapping (switching out of the drug class) is preferable after primary or secondary loss of response to the first biologic agent. In the near future, treatment algorithms might evolve with the launch of new drugs (such as ustekinumab, tofacitinib and etrolizumab) and the increased use of biosimilars.},

Genotype imputation increases statistical power, facilitates fine mapping of causal variants, and plays a key role in meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies. Only variants that were previously observed in a reference panel of sequenced individuals can be imputed. However, the rapid increase in the number of deeply sequenced individuals will soon make it possible to assemble enormous reference panels that greatly increase the number of imputable variants. In this review, we present an overview of genotype imputation and describe the computational techniques that make it possible to impute genotypes from reference panels with millions of individuals.},

  abstract = {We respond to criticisms of Mendelian randomization (MR) by Mukamal, Stampfer and Rimm (MSR). MSR consider that MR is receiving too much attention and should be renamed. We explain how MR links to Mendel’s laws, the origin of the name and our lack of concern regarding nomenclature. We address MSR’s substantive points regarding MR of alcohol and cardiovascular disease, an issue on which they dispute the MR findings. We demonstrate that their strictures with respect to population stratification, confounding, weak instrument bias, pleiotropy and confounding have been addressed, and summarise how the field has advanced in relation to the issues they raise. We agree with MSR that “the hard problem of conducting high-quality, reproducible epidemiology” should be addressed by epidemiologists. However we see more evidence of confrontation of this issue within MR, as opposed to conventional observational epidemiology, within which the same methods that have demonstrably failed in the past are simply rolled out into new areas, leaving their previous failures unexamined.},

  abstract = {Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are characterized by dysregulation of the normal immune response, which leads to inflammation. Together, they account for a high disease burden in the population, given that they are usually chronic conditions with associated co-morbidities. Examples include systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease and type 1 diabetes. Since the advent of genome-wide association studies, evidence of considerable genetic overlap in the loci predisposing to a wide range of IMIDs has emerged. Understanding the genetic risk and extent of genetic overlap between IMIDs may help to determine which genes control which aspects of the different diseases; it may identify potential novel therapeutic targets for a number of these conditions, and/or it may facilitate repurposing existing therapies developed originally for different conditions. The findings show that autoantibody-mediated autoimmune diseases cluster more closely with each other than autoantibody-negative diseases such as psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, Crohn’s disease and ankylosing spondylitis which, instead, form a seronegative genetic cluster. The genetic clustering largely mirrors the known response to existing biological therapies, but apparent anomalies in treatment response are discussed.},

Bonferroni correction, though computationally trivial, is overly conservative and fails to account for linkage disequilibrium between variants. Permutation-based methods are more powerful, though computationally far more intensive. We present an alternative correction method called eigenMT, which runs over 500 times faster than permutations and has adjusted p values that closely approximate empirical ones. To achieve this speed while also maintaining the accuracy of permutation-based methods, we estimate the effective number of independent variants tested for association with a particular gene, termed Meff, by using the eigenvalue decomposition of the genotype correlation matrix. We employ a regularized estimator of the correlation matrix to ensure Meff is robust and yields adjusted p values that closely approximate p values from permutations. Finally, using a common genotype matrix, we show that eigenMT can be applied with even greater efficiency to studies across tissues or conditions. Our method provides a simpler, more efficient approach to multiple-testing correction than existing methods and fits within existing pipelines for eQTL discovery.},

  abstract = {Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) are increasingly popular in the social sciences, not only in medicine. We argue that the lay public, and sometimes researchers, put too much trust in RCTs over other methods of investigation. Contrary to frequent claims in the applied literature, randomization does not equalize everything other than the treatment in the treatment and control groups, it does not automatically deliver a precise estimate of the average treatment effect (ATE), and it does not relieve us of the need to think about (observed or unobserved) covariates. Finding out whether an estimate was generated by chance is more difficult than commonly believed. At best, an RCT yields an unbiased estimate, but this property is of limited practical value. Even then, estimates apply only to the sample selected for the trial, often no more than a convenience sample, and justification is required to extend the results to other groups, including any population to which the trial sample belongs, or to any individual, including an individual in the trial. Demanding ‘external validity’ is unhelpful because it expects too much of an RCT while undervaluing its potential contribution. RCTs do indeed require minimal assumptions and can operate with little prior knowledge. This is an advantage when persuading distrustful audiences, but it is a disadvantage for cumulative scientific progress, where prior knowledge should be built upon, not discarded. RCTs can play a role in building scientific knowledge and useful predictions but they can only do so as part of a cumulative program, combining with other methods, including conceptual and theoretical development, to discover not ‘what works’, but ‘why things work’.},

Yet, it is an element of the variance that can be measured very precisely and will play an important role in the design of future studies.

We identified 25 new susceptibility loci, 3 of which contain integrin genes that encode proteins in pathways that have been identified as important therapeutic targets in inflammatory bowel disease. The associated variants are correlated with expression changes in response to immune stimulus at two of these genes (ITGA4 and ITGB8) and at previously implicated loci (ITGAL and ICAM1). In all four cases, the expression-increasing allele also increases disease risk. We also identified likely causal missense variants in a gene implicated in primary immune deficiency, PLCG2, and a negative regulator of inflammation, SLAMF8.

  abstract = {IBD is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract encompassing two main clinical entities: Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. Although Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis have historically been studied together because they share common features (such as symptoms, structural damage and therapy), it is now clear that they represent two distinct pathophysiological entities. Both Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are associated with multiple pathogenic factors including environmental changes, an array of susceptibility gene variants, a qualitatively and quantitatively abnormal gut microbiota and a broadly dysregulated immune response. In spite of this realization and the identification of seemingly pertinent environmental, genetic, microbial and immune factors, a full understanding of IBD pathogenesis is still out of reach and, consequently, treatment is far from optimal. An important reason for this unsatisfactory situation is the currently limited comprehension of what are the truly relevant components of IBD immunopathogenesis. This article will comprehensively review current knowledge of the classic immune components and will expand the concept of IBD immunopathogenesis to include various cells, mediators and pathways that have not been traditionally associated with disease mechanisms, but that profoundly affect the overall intestinal inflammatory process.},

  abstract = {This paper sets out a generalised linear model (GLM) framework for the synthesis of data from randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We describe a common model taking the form of a linear regression for both fixed and random effects synthesis, that can be implemented with Normal, Binomial, Poisson, and Multinomial data. The familiar logistic model for meta- analysis with Binomial data is a GLM with a logit link function, which is appropriate for probability outcomes. The same linear regression framework can be applied to continuous outcomes, rate models, competing risks, or ordered category outcomes, by using other link functions, such as identity, log, complementary log-log, and probit link functions. The common core model for the linear predictor can be applied to pair-wise meta-analysis, indirect comparisons, synthesis of multi-arm trials, and mixed treatment comparisons, also known as network meta-analysis, without distinction. We take a Bayesian approach to estimation and provide WinBUGS program code for a Bayesian analysis using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. An advantage of this approach is that it is straightforward to extend to shared parameter models where different RCTs report outcomes in different formats but from a common underlying model. Use of the GLM framework allows us to present a unified account of how models can be compared using the Deviance Information Criterion (DIC), and how goodness of fit can be assessed using the residual deviance. WinBUGS code for model critique is provided. Our approach is illustrated through a range of worked examples for the commonly encountered evidence formats, including shared parameter models. We give suggestions on computational issues that sometimes arise in MCMC evidence synthesis, and comment briefly on alternative software.},

  abstract = {IBD treatment is undergoing a transformation with an expanding repertoire of drugs targeting different aspects of the immune response. Three novel classes of drugs have emerged in the past decade that target leukocyte trafficking to the gut (vedolizumab), neutralize key cytokines with antibodies (ustekinumab) and inhibit cytokine signalling pathways (tofacitinib). In advanced development are other drugs for IBD, including therapies targeting other cytokines such as IL-23 and IL-6. However, all agents tested so far are hampered by primary and secondary loss of response, so it is desirable to develop personalized strategies to identify which patients should be treated with which drugs. Stratification of patients with IBD by clinical parameters alone lacks sensitivity{$\mkern1mu$}, and alternative modalities are now needed to deliver precision medicine in IBD. High-r esolution profiling of immune response networks in individual patients is a promising approach and different technical platforms, including in vivo real-t ime molecular endoscopy{$\mkern1mu$}, tissue transcriptomics and germline genetics, are promising tools to help predict responses to specific therapies. However, important challenges remain regarding the clinical utility of these technologies, including their scalability and accessibility. This Review focuses on unravelling some of the complexity of mucosal immune responses in IBD pathogenesis and how current and emerging analytical platforms might be harnessed to effectively stratify and individualise IBD therapy.},

  abstract = {Background Nonresponse and loss of response to anti-TNF therapies in Crohn’s disease represent significant clinical problems for which clear management guidelines are lacking. Aim To review the incidence, mechanisms and predictors of primary nonresponse and secondary loss of response to formulate practical clinical algorithms to guide management. Methods Through a systematic literature review, 503 articles were identified which fit the inclusion criteria. Results Primary nonresponse to anti-TNF treatment affects 13–40\% of patients. Secondary loss of response to anti-TNF occurs in 23–46\% of patients when determined according to dose intensification, and 5–13\% of patients when gauged by drug discontinuation rates. Recent evidence suggests that the mechanisms underlying primary nonresponse and secondary loss of response are multifactorial and include disease characteristics (phenotype, location, severity); drug (pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic or immunogenicity) and treatment strategy (dosing regimen) related factors. Clinical algorithms that employ therapeutic drug monitoring (using anti-TNF tough levels and anti-drug antibody levels) may be used to determine the underlying cause of primary nonresponse and secondary loss of response respectively and guide clinicians as to which patients are most likely to respond to anti-TNF therapy and help optimise drug therapy for those who are losing response to anti-TNF therapy. Conclusions Nonresponse or loss of response to anti-TNF occurs commonly in Crohn’s disease. Clinical algorithms utilising therapeutic drug monitoring may establish the mechanisms for treatment failure and help guide the subsequent therapeutic approach.},

I discuss the consequences of the choice, including the recovery of inter-block information when available, give a simple example to illustrate the connection between recovery of inter-block information and pooling two estimators of a treatment effect, and give an example where fitting a model with random block effects can lead to the wrong answer. I suggest that block effects should be modeled as fixed effects unless there are compelling reasons to do otherwise.},

The results showed that rotavirus is associated with 65.6\% (889/1355) of diarrheal admissions. Rotavirus infection mostly affected children under 2 years of age with a peak incidence in children 1 to 2 years of age (75.7\%) and it occurs year round with a slight seasonal pattern; 99.5\% of the specimens could be G-typed: G1 was predominant (68.7\%), followed by G4 (15.4\%), G2 (12.3\%), G3 (0.6\%), and G9 (0.5\%). High identities of VP7 nucleotide (96.3 to 96.9\%) and deduced amino acid (98.1 to 98.4\%) were found between two Vietnamese G9 strains and also the recent emergence of G9 strains US 1205, Brazilian R143, and Malawian MW69. Mixed infections were identified in 17 (2.0\%), and 5 strains (0.5\%) remained untypable. The four most common worldwide strains, G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], and G4P[8], constituted 81.1\% of all rotaviruses typed with G1P[8] being the most prevalent type (58.2\%). Unusual G/P combinations (11 strains) were detected in 11.7\% of all strains, of which, G1P[4] was the most prevalent, accounting for 5.6\% of the total. Several combinations of G and P types were observed in this study, suggesting a complex rotavirus infection pattern in Vietnam. This study has provided for the first time clear indication on the circulating G and P genotypes among hospitalized children in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The results suggest that these viral infections are prevalent among hospitalized children and that the four most common worldwide G types as well as the four most common G-P combinations were also infecting children in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. This result could have important implications for rotavirus vaccine programs and for understanding the epidemiological characteristics of human rotavirus in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.},

  abstract = {Causal genes and variants within genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci can be identified by integrating GWAS statistics with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and determining which SNPs underlie both GWAS and eQTL signals. Most analyses, however, consider only the marginal eQTL signal, rather than dissecting this signal into multiple independent eQTL for each gene. Here we show that analyzing conditional eQTL signatures, which could be important under specific cellular or temporal contexts, leads to improved fine mapping of GWAS associations. Using genotypes and gene expression levels from post-mortem human brain samples (N=467) reported by the CommonMind Consortium (CMC), we find that conditional eQTL are widespread; 63\% of genes with primary eQTL also have conditional eQTL. In addition, genomic features associated with conditional eQTL are consistent with context specific (i.e. tissue, cell type, or developmental time point specific) regulation of gene expression. Integrating the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium schizophrenia (SCZ) GWAS and CMC conditional eQTL data reveals forty loci with strong evidence for co-localization (posterior probability \&gt;0.8), including six loci with co-localization of conditional eQTL. Our co-localization analyses support previously reported genes and identify novel genes for schizophrenia risk, and provide specific hypotheses for their functional follow-up. Note: Eli A.

  abstract = {The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) resource has contributed a wealth of novel insights into the regulatory impact of genetic variation on gene expression across human tissues, however thus far has not been utilized to study how variation acts at the resolution of the different cell types composing the tissues. To address this gap, using liver and skin as a proof-of-concept tissues, we show that readily available signature genes based on expression profiles of mouse cell types can be used to deconvolute the cellular composition of human GTEx tissues. We then deconvoluted 6,829 bulk RNA-seq samples corresponding to 28 GTEx tissues and show that we are able to quantify cellular heterogeneity, determining both the different cell types present in each of the tissues and how their proportions vary between samples of the same tissue type. Conducting eQTL analyses for GTEx liver and skin samples using cell type composition estimates as interaction terms, we identified thousands of novel genetic associations that had lower effect sizes and were cell-type-associated. We further show that cell-type-associated eQTLs in skin colocalize with melanoma, malignant neoplasm, and infection signatures, indicating variants that influence gene expression in distinct skin cell types play important roles in skin traits and disease. Overall, our study provides a framework to estimate the relative fractions of different cell types in GTEx tissues using signature genes from mouse cell types and functionally characterize human genetic variation that impacts gene expression in a cell-type-specific manner.},

  abstract = {Hierarchically-organized data arise naturally in many psychology and neuroscience studies. As the standard assumption of independent and identically distributed samples does not hold for such data, two important problems are to accurately estimate group-level effect sizes, and to obtain powerful statistical tests against group-level null hypotheses. A common approach is to summarize subject-level data by a single quantity per subject, which is often the mean or the difference between class means, and treat these as samples in a group-level t-test. This “naive” approach is, however, suboptimal in terms of statistical power, as it ignores information about the intra-subject variance. To address this issue, we review several approaches to deal with nested data, with a focus on methods that are easy to implement. With what we call the sufficient-summary-statistic approach, we highlight a computationally efficient technique that can improve statistical power by taking into account within-subject variances, and we provide step-by-step instructions on how to apply this approach to a number of frequently-used measures of effect size. The properties of the reviewed approaches and the potential benefits over a group-level t-test are quantitatively assessed on simulated data and demonstrated on EEG data from a simulated-driving experiment.},

  abstract = {Polygenic scores have recently been used to summarise genetic effects among an ensemble of markers that do not individually achieve significance in a large-scale association study. Markers are selected using an initial training sample and used to construct a score in an independent replication sample by forming the weighted sum of associated alleles within each subject. Association between a trait and this composite score implies that a genetic signal is present among the selected markers, and the score can then be used for prediction of individual trait values. This approach has been used to obtain evidence of a genetic effect when no single markers are significant, to establish a common genetic basis for related disorders, and to construct risk prediction models. In some cases, however, the desired association or prediction has not been achieved. Here, the power and predictive accuracy of a polygenic score are derived from a quantitative genetics model as a function of the sizes of the two samples, explained genetic variance, selection thresholds for including a marker in the score, and methods for weighting effect sizes in the score. Expressions are derived for quantitative and discrete traits, the latter allowing for case/control sampling. A novel approach to estimating the variance explained by a marker panel is also proposed. It is shown that published studies with significant association of polygenic scores have been well powered, whereas those with negative results can be explained by low sample size. It is also shown that useful levels of prediction may only be approached when predictors are estimated from very large samples, up to an order of magnitude greater than currently available. Therefore, polygenic scores currently have more utility for association testing than predicting complex traits, but prediction will become more feasible as sample sizes continue to grow.},

Signatures reflective of interferon-related antiviral pathways were common up to day 4 of symptoms in patients who did not require mechanical ventilator support; in those who needed mechanical ventilation, an inflammatory, activated-neutrophil and cell-stress or death (‘bacterial’) pattern was seen, even early in disease. Identifiable bacterial co-infection was not necessary for this ‘bacterial’ signature but was able to enhance its development while attenuating the early ‘viral’ signature. Our findings emphasize the importance of timing and severity in the interpretation of host responses to acute viral infection and identify specific patterns of immune-system activation that might enable the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools for severe influenza.},

Conditioned on a tissue, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) are genetic variants associated with gene expression, and eGenes are genes whose expression levels are associated with genetic variants. eQTLs and eGenes provide great supporting evidence for GWAS hits and important insights into the regulatory pathways involved in many diseases. When a significant variant or a candidate gene identified by GWAS is also an eQTL or eGene, there is strong evidence to further study this variant or gene. Multi-tissue gene expression datasets like the Gene Tissue Expression (GTEx) data are used to find eQTLs and eGenes. Unfortunately, these datasets often have small sample sizes in some tissues. For this reason, there have been many meta-analysis methods designed to combine gene expression data across many tissues to increase power for finding eQTLs and eGenes. However, these existing techniques are not scalable to datasets containing many tissues, like the GTEx data. Furthermore, these methods ignore a biological insight that the same variant may be associated with the same gene across similar tissues.},

  abstract = {A test of association between the phenotype and a set of genes within a biological pathway can be complementary to single variant or single gene association analysis and provide further insights into the genetic architecture of complex phenotypes. Although multiple methods exist to perform such a gene-set analysis, most have low statistical power when only a small fraction of the genes are associated with the phenotype. Further, since existing methods cannot identify possible genes driving association signals, interpreting results of such association in terms of the underlying genetic mechanism is challenging. Here, we introduce Gene-set analysis Association Using Sparse Signals (GAUSS), a method for gene-set association analysis with GWAS summary statistics. In addition to providing a p-value for association, GAUSS identifies the subset of genes that have the maximal evidence of association and appears to drive the association. Using pre-computed correlation structure among test statistics from a reference panel, the p-value calculation is substantially faster compared to other permutation or simulationbased approaches. Our numerical experiments show that GAUSS can increase power over several existing methods while controlling type-I error under a variety of association models. Through the analysis of summary statistics from the UK Biobank data for 1,403 phenotypes, we show that GAUSS is scalable and can identify associations across many phenotypes and genesets.},

The development of new diagnostic, prophylactic, therapeutic and curative strategies is critical to address this burden but is predicated on a detailed understanding of the immensely complex relationship between pathogens and their hosts. Traditional, reductionist approaches to investigate this dynamic often lack the scale and/or scope to faithfully model the dual and co-dependent nature of this relationship, limiting the success of translational efforts. With recent advances in large-scale, quantitative omics methods as well as in integrative analytical strategies, systems biology approaches for the study of infectious disease are quickly forming a new paradigm for how we understand and model host–pathogen relationships for translational applications. Here, we delineate a framework for a systems biology approach to infectious disease in three parts: discovery — the design, collection and analysis of omics data; representation — the iterative modelling, integration and visualization of complex data sets; and application — the interpretation and hypothesis-based inquiry towards translational outcomes.},

  abstract = {A statistical hypothesis test is one of the most eminent methods in statistics. Its pivotal role comes from the wide range of practical problems it can be applied to and the sparsity of data requirements. Being an unsupervised method makes it very flexible in adapting to real-world situations. The availability of high-dimensional data makes it necessary to apply such statistical hypothesis tests simultaneously to the test statistics of the underlying covariates. However, if applied without correction this leads to an inevitable increase in Type 1 errors. To counteract this effect, multiple testing procedures have been introduced to control various types of errors, most notably the Type 1 error. In this paper, we review modern multiple testing procedures for controlling either the family-wise error (FWER) or the false-discovery rate (FDR). We emphasize their principal approach allowing categorization of them as (1) single-step vs. stepwise approaches, (2) adaptive vs. non-adaptive approaches, and (3) marginal vs. joint multiple testing procedures. We place a particular focus on procedures that can deal with data with a (strong) correlation structure because real-world data are rarely uncorrelated. Furthermore, we also provide background information making the often technically intricate methods accessible for interdisciplinary data scientists.},

  abstract = {Approaches based on linear mixed models (LMMs) have recently gained popularity for modelling population substructure and relatedness in genome-wide association studies. In the last few years, a bewildering variety of different LMM methods/software packages have been developed, but it is not always clear how (or indeed whether) any newlyproposed method differs from previously-proposed implementations. Here we compare the performance of several LMM approaches (and software implementations, including EMMAX, GenABEL, FaST-LMM, Mendel, GEMMA and MMM) via their application to a genome-wide association study of visceral leishmaniasis in 348 Brazilian families comprising 3626 individuals (1972 genotyped). The implementations differ in precise details of methodology implemented and through various user-chosen options such as the method and number of SNPs used to estimate the kinship (relatedness) matrix. We investigate sensitivity to these choices and the success (or otherwise) of the approaches in controlling the overall genome-wide error-rate for both real and simulated phenotypes. We compare the LMM results to those obtained using traditional family-based association tests (based on transmission of alleles within pedigrees) and to alternative approaches implemented in the software packages MQLS, ROADTRIPS and MASTOR. We find strong concordance between the results from different LMM approaches, and all are successful in controlling the genome-wide error rate (except for some approaches when applied naively to longitudinal data with many repeated measures). We also find high correlation between LMMs and alternative approaches (apart from transmission-based approaches when applied to SNPs with small or non-existent effects). We conclude that LMM approaches perform well in comparison to competing approaches. Given their strong concordance, in most applications, the choice of precise LMM implementation cannot be based on power/type I error considerations but must instead be based on considerations such as speed and ease-of-use.},

Here, we overview both widely applied and newer statistical methods for GWAS meta-analysis, including issues of interpretation and assessment of sources of heterogeneity. We also discuss extensions of these meta-analysis methods to complex data. Where possible, we provide guidelines for researchers who are planning to use these methods. Furthermore, we address special issues that may arise for meta-analysis of sequencing data and rare variants. Finally, we discuss challenges and solutions surrounding the goals of making meta-analysis data publicly available and building powerful consortia.},

  abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is an approach that uses genetic variants associated with a modifiable exposure or biological intermediate to estimate the causal relationship between these variables and a medically relevant outcome. Although it was initially developed to examine the relationship between modifiable exposures/biomarkers and disease, its use has expanded to encompass applications in molecular epidemiology, systems biology, pharmacogenomics, and many other areas. The purpose of this review is to introduce MR, the principles behind the approach, and its limitations. We consider some of the new applications of the methodology, including informing drug development, and comment on some promising extensions, including two-step, two-sample, and bidirectional MR. We show how these new methods can be combined to efficiently examine causality in complex biological networks and provide a new framework to data mine high-dimensional studies as we transition into the age of hypothesis-free causality.},

  abstract = {RNA-Seq is a widely used method for studying the behavior of genes under different biological conditions. An essential step in an RNA-Seq study is normalization, in which raw data are adjusted to account for factors that prevent direct comparison of expression measures. Errors in normalization can have a significant impact on downstream analysis, such as inflated false positives in differential expression analysis. An underemphasized feature of normalization is the assumptions on which the methods rely and how the validity of these assumptions can have a substantial impact on the performance of the methods. In this article, we explain how assumptions provide the link between raw RNA-Seq read counts and meaningful measures of gene expression. We examine normalization methods from the perspective of their assumptions, as an understanding of methodological assumptions is necessary for choosing methods appropriate for the data at hand. Furthermore, we discuss why normalization methods perform poorly when their assumptions are violated and how this causes problems in subsequent analysis. To analyze a biological experiment, researchers must select a normalization method with assumptions that are met and that produces a meaningful measure of expression for the given experiment.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies have identified breast cancer risk variants in over 150 genomic regions, but the mechanisms underlying risk remain largely unknown. These regions were explored by combining association analysis with in silico genomic feature annotations. We defined 205 independent risk-associated signals with the set of credible causal variants (CCVs) in each one. In parallel, we used a Bayesian approach (PAINTOR) that combines genetic association, linkage disequilibrium, and enriched genomic features to determine variants with high posterior probabilities (HPPs) of being causal. Potentially causal variants were significantly over-represented in active gene regulatory regions and transcription factor binding sites. We applied our INQUSIT pipeline for prioritizing genes as targets of potentially causal variants, using gene expression (eQTL), chromatin interaction and functional annotations. Known cancer drivers, transcription factors and genes in the developmental, apoptosis, immune system and DNA integrity checkpoint gene ontology pathways, were over-represented among the 178 highest confidence target genes.},

  abstract = {Background: During the last 30 years, the median sample size of research studies published in high-impact medical journals has increased manyfold, while the use of non-parametric tests has increased at the expense of t-tests. This paper explores this paradoxical practice and illustrates its consequences. Methods: A simulation study is used to compare the rejection rates of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney (WMW) test and the two-sample t-test for increasing sample size. Samples are drawn from skewed distributions with equal means and medians but with a small difference in spread. A hypothetical case study is used for illustration and motivation. Results: The WMW test produces, on average, smaller p-values than the t-test. This discrepancy increases with increasing sample size, skewness, and difference in spread. For heavily skewed data, the proportion of p {$<$} 0.05 with the WMW test can be greater than 90\% if the standard deviations differ by 10\% and the number of observations is 1000 in each group. The high rejection rates of the WMW test should be interpreted as the power to detect that the probability that a random sample from one of the distributions is less than a random sample from the other distribution is greater than 50\%. Conclusions: Non-parametric tests are most useful for small studies. Using non-parametric tests in large studies may provide answers to the wrong question, thus confusing readers. For studies with a large sample size, t-tests and their corresponding confidence intervals can and should be used even for heavily skewed data.},

  abstract = {Recent work has demonstrated that some functional categories of the genome contribute disproportionately to the heritability of complex diseases. Here we analyze a broad set of functional elements, including cell type–specific elements, to estimate their polygenic contributions to heritability in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 17 complex diseases and traits with an average sample size of 73,599. To enable this analysis, we introduce a new method, stratified LD score regression, for partitioning heritability from GWAS summary statistics while accounting for linked markers. This new method is computationally tractable at very large sample sizes and leverages genome-wide information. Our findings include a large enrichment of heritability in conserved regions across many traits, a very large immunological disease–specific enrichment of heritability in FANTOM5 enhancers and many cell type–specific enrichments, including significant enrichment of central nervous system cell types in the heritability of body mass index, age at menarche, educational attainment and smoking behavior.},

  abstract = {The management of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has been transformed over the last two decades by the arrival of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonist agents. Recently, alternative drugs have been approved, directed at leukocyte-trafficking molecules (vedolizumab) or other inflammatory cytokines (ustekinumab). New therapeutics are currently being developed in IBD and represent promising targets as they involve other mechanisms of action (JAK molecules, Smad 7 antisense oligonucleotide etc.). Beyond TNF antagonist agents, these alternative drugs are needed for early-stage treatment of patients with aggressive IBD or when the disease is resistant to conventional therapy. Personalized medicine involves the determination of patients with a high risk of progression and complications, and better characterization of patients who may respond preferentially to specific therapies. Indeed, more and more studies aim to identify factors predictive of drug response (corresponding to a specific signaling pathway) that could better manage treatment for patients with IBD. Once treatment has started, disease monitoring is essential and remote patient care could in some circumstances be an attractive option. Telemedicine improves medical adherence and quality of life, and has a positive impact on health outcomes of patients with IBD. This review discusses the current application of personalized medicine to the management of patients with IBD and the advantages and limits of telemedicine in IBD.},

  abstract = {Author Summary  Genetic variants that are associated with gene expression are known as expression Quantitative Trait Loci, or eQTLs. Many studies have been conducted to identify eQTLs, and they have proven an effective tool for identifying putative regulatory variants and linking them to specific genes. Up to now most studies have been conducted in a single tissue or cell type, but moving forward this is changing, and ongoing studies are collecting data aimed at mapping eQTLs in dozens of tissues. Current statistical methods are not able to fully exploit the richness of these kinds of data, taking account of both the sharing and differences in eQTLs among tissues. In this paper we develop a statistical framework to address this problem, to improve power to detect eQTLs when they are shared among multiple tissues, and to allow for differences among tissues to be estimated. Applying these methods to data from three tissues suggests that sharing of eQTLs among tissues may be substantially more common than it appeared in previous analyses of the same data.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of genomic regions affecting complex diseases. The next challenge is to elucidate the causal genes and mechanisms involved. One approach is to use statistical colocalization to assess shared genetic aetiology across multiple related traits (e.g. molecular traits, metabolic pathways and complex diseases) to identify causal pathways, prioritize causal variants and evaluate pleiotropy. We propose HyPrColoc (Hypothesis Prioritisation in multi-trait Colocalization), an efficient deterministic Bayesian algorithm using GWAS summary statistics that can detect colocalization across vast numbers of traits simultaneously (e.g. 100 traits can be jointly analysed in around 1 second). We performed a genome-wide multi-trait colocalization analysis of coronary heart disease (CHD) and fourteen related traits. HyPrColoc identified 43 regions in which CHD colocalized with ≥1 trait, including 5 potentially new CHD loci. Across the 43 loci, we further integrated gene and protein expression quantitative trait loci to identify candidate causal genes.},

We generated antibody landscapes to study immune profiles covering 43 years of influenza A/H3N2 virus evolution for 69 individuals monitored for infection over 6 years and for 225 individuals pre- and postvaccination. Upon infection and vaccination, titers increased broadly, including previously encountered viruses far beyond the extent of cross-reactivity observed after a primary infection. We explored implications for vaccination and found that the use of an antigenically advanced virus had the dual benefit of inducing antibodies against both advanced and previous antigenic clusters.

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                        Drug development and biological discovery require effective strategies to map existing genetic associations to causal genes. To approach this problem, we identified a set of positive control genes for 12 common diseases and traits that cause a Mendelian form of the disease or are the target of a medicine used for disease treatment. We then identified a simple set of genomic features enriching GWAS single nucleotide variants for these positive control genes. Using these features, we trained and validated the Effector Index (             Ei             ), a causal gene mapping algorithm using the 12 common diseases and traits. The area under             Ei’s             receiver operator curve to identify positive control genes was 80\% and area under the precision recall curve was 29\%. Using an enlarged set of independently curated positive control genes for type 2 diabetes which included genes identified by large-scale exome sequencing, these areas increased to 85\% and 61\%, respectively. The best predictors were coding or transcript altering variation, distance to gene and open chromatin-based metrics. We provide the             Ei             algorithm for its widespread use.             Ei             provides a simple, understandable tool to prioritize genes at GWAS loci for functional follow-up and drug development.},

In this study hepatitis B virus (HBV)-naive older adults received three vaccines, including one against HBV. Here we show, using transcriptional and cytometric profiling of whole blood collected before vaccination, that heightened expression of genes that augment B-cell responses and higher memory B-cell frequencies correlate with stronger responses to HBV vaccine. In contrast, higher levels of inflammatory response transcripts and increased frequencies of pro-inflammatory innate cells correlate with weaker responses to this vaccine. Increased numbers of erythrocytes and the haem-induced response also correlate with poor response to the HBV vaccine. A transcriptomics-based pre-vaccination predictor of response to HBV vaccine is built and validated in distinct sets of older adults. This moderately accurate (area under the curve≈65\%) but robust signature is supported by flow cytometry and cytokine profiling. This study is the first that identifies baseline predictors and mechanisms of response to the HBV vaccine.},

This is the first report to demonstrate that intrinsic B cell defects with age contribute to reduced antibody responses to the influenza vaccine. The level of AID in response to CpG before vaccination can also predict the robustness of the vaccine response.

We therefore compared the cis-effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on gene expression between blood samples from 1,240 human subjects and four primary non-blood tissues (liver, subcutaneous, and visceral adipose tissue and skeletal muscle) from 85 subjects. We characterized four different mechanisms for 2,072 probes that show tissue-dependent genetic regulation between blood and non-blood tissues: on average 33.2\% only showed cis-regulation in non-blood tissues; 14.5\% of the eQTL probes were regulated by different, independent SNPs depending on the tissue of investigation. 47.9\% showed a different effect size although they were regulated by the same SNPs. Surprisingly, we observed that 4.4\% were regulated by the same SNP but with opposite allelic direction. We show here that SNPs that are located in transcriptional regulatory elements are enriched for tissue-dependent regulation, including SNPs at 39 and 59 untranslated regions (P = 1.8461025 and 4.761024, respectively) and SNPs that are synonymous-coding (P = 9.961024). SNPs that are associated with complex traits more often exert a tissue-dependent effect on gene expression (P = 2.6610210). Our study yields new insights into the genetic basis of tissue-dependent expression and suggests that complex trait associated genetic variants have even more complex regulatory effects than previously anticipated.},

  abstract = {Despite the importance of the immune system in many diseases, there are currently no objective benchmarks of immunological health. In an effort to identifying such markers, we used influenza vaccination in 30 young (20-30 years) and 59 older subjects (60 to {$>$}89 years) as models for strong and weak immune responses, respectively, and assayed their serological responses to influenza strains as well as a wide variety of other parameters, including gene expression, antibodies to hemagglutinin peptides, serum cytokines, cell subset phenotypes and in vitro cytokine stimulation. Using machine learning, we identified nine variables that predict the antibody response with 84\% accuracy. Two of these variables are involved in apoptosis, which positively associated with the response to vaccination and was confirmed to be a contributor to vaccine responsiveness in mice. The identification of these biomarkers provides new insights into what immune features may be most important for immune health.},

  abstract = {Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are powerful paradigms for mapping the determinants of gene expression and organismal phenotypes, respectively. However, eQTL mapping and GWAS are limited in scope (to naturally occurring, common genetic variants) and resolution (by linkage disequilibrium). Here, we present crisprQTL mapping, a framework in which large numbers of CRISPR/Cas9 perturbations are introduced to each cell on an isogenic background, followed by single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). crisprQTL mapping is analogous to conventional human eQTL studies, but with individual humans replaced by individual cells; genetic variants replaced by unique combinations of unlinked guide RNA (gRNA)-programmed perturbations per cell; and tissue-level RNA-seq of many individuals replaced by scRNA-seq of many cells. By randomly introducing gRNAs, a single population of cells can be leveraged to test for association between each perturbation and the expression of any potential target gene, analogous to how eQTL studies leverage populations of humans to test millions of genetic variants for associations with expression in a genome-wide manner. However, crisprQTL mapping is neither limited to naturally occurring, common genetic variants nor by linkage disequilibrium. As a proof-of-concept, we applied crisprQTL mapping to evaluate 1,119 candidate enhancers with no strong a priori hypothesis as to their target gene(s). Perturbations were made by a nuclease-dead Cas9 tethered to KRAB, and introduced at a mean "allele frequency" of 1.1\% into a population of 47,650 profiled human K562 cells (median of 15 gRNAs identified per cell). We tested for differential expression of all genes within 1 megabase of each candidate enhancer, effectively evaluating 17,584 potential enhancer-target gene relationships within a single experiment. At an empirical false discovery rate of 10\%, we identify 128 cis crisprQTLs (11\%) whose targeting resulted in downregulation of 105 nearby genes. crisprQTLs were strongly enriched for proximity to their target genes (median 34.3 kilobases) and the strength of H3K27ac, p300, and lineage-specific transcription factor ChIP-seq peaks. Our results establish the power of the eQTL mapping paradigm as applied to programmed variation in populations of cells, rather than natural variation in populations of individuals. We anticipate that crisprQTL mapping will facilitate the comprehensive elucidation of the cis-regulatory architecture of the human genome.},

Thus, finding predictive biomarkers of non-response prior to commencing anti-TNFα therapy is of high value. Design\hspace{0.6em} We analysed publicly available whole-genome expression profiles of colon biopsies obtained from multiple cohorts of patients with IBD using a combined computational deconvolution—meta-analysis paradigm which allows to estimate immune cell contribution to the measured expression and capture differential regulatory programmes otherwise masked due to variation in cellular composition. Insights from this in silico approach were experimentally validated in biopsies and blood samples of three independent test cohorts. Results\hspace{0.6em} We found the proportion of plasma cells as a robust pretreatment biomarker of non-response to therapy, which we validated in two independent cohorts of immune-stained colon biopsies, where a plasma cellular score from inflamed biopsies was predictive of non-response with an area under the curve (AUC) of 82\%. Meta-analysis of the cell proportion-adjusted gene expression data suggested that an increase in inflammatory macrophages in anti-TNFα non-responding individuals is associated with the upregulation of the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) and chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2)chemokine ligand 7 (CCL7) –axes. Blood gene expression analysis of an independent cohort, identified TREM-1 downregulation in non-responders at baseline, which was predictive of response with an AUC of 94\%. Conclusions\hspace{0.6em} Our study proposes two clinically feasible assays, one in biopsy and one in blood, for predicting non-response to anti-TNFα therapy prior to initiation of treatment. Moreover, it suggests that mechanism-driven novel drugs for non-responders should be developed.},

In the absence of suitable gold standards, evaluations are commonly restricted to selected datasets and biological reasoning on the relevance of resulting enriched gene sets. Results: We develop an extensible framework for reproducible benchmarking of enrichment methods based on defined criteria for applicability, gene set prioritization and detection of relevant processes. This framework incorporates a curated compendium of 75 expression datasets investigating 42 human diseases. The compendium features microarray and RNA-seq measurements, and each dataset is associated with a precompiled GO/KEGG relevance ranking for the corresponding disease under investigation. We perform a comprehensive assessment of 10 major enrichment methods, identifying significant differences in runtime and applicability to RNA-seq data, fraction of enriched gene sets depending on the null hypothesis tested and recovery of the predefined relevance rankings. We make practical recommendations on how methods originally developed for microarray data can efficiently be applied to RNA-seq data, how to interpret results depending on the type of gene set test conducted and which methods are best suited to effectively prioritize gene sets with high phenotype relevance.},

  abstract = {Applied researchers often find themselves making statistical inferences in settings that would seem to require multiple comparisons adjustments. We challenge the Type I error paradigm that underlies these corrections. Moreover we posit that the problem of multiple comparisons can disappear entirely when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically keep the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting the p values corresponding to intervals of fixed width). Thus, multilevel models address the multiple comparisons problem and also yield more efficient estimates, especially in settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons are a particular concern.},

However, power analysis is flawed in that a narrow emphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study design. In noisy, small-sample settings, statistically significant results can often be misleading. To help researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction (Type S [sign] error) and (b) the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated (Type M [magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information.},

  abstract = {Genetic association studies, in particular the genome-wide association study (GWAS) design, have provided a wealth of novel insights into the aetiology of a wide range of human diseases and traits, in particular cardiovascular diseases and lipid biomarkers. The next challenge consists of understanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of multiple association datasets, including gene expression datasets, can contribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to assess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal variant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be integrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the approach by re-analysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with a published meta-analysis of lipid traits including .100,000 individuals of European ancestry. Combining all lipid biomarkers, our re-analysis supported 26 out of 38 reported colocalisation results with eQTLs and identified 14 new colocalisation results, hence highlighting the value of a formal statistical test. In three cases of reported eQTL-lipid pairs (SYPL2, IFT172, TBKBP1) for which our analysis suggests that the eQTL pattern is not consistent with the lipid association, we identify alternative colocalisation results with SORT1, GCKR, and KPNB1, indicating that these genes are more likely to be causal in these genomic intervals. A key feature of the method is the ability to derive the output statistics from single SNP summary statistics, hence making it possible to perform systematic meta-analysis type comparisons across multiple GWAS datasets (implemented online at http://coloc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/coloc/). Our methodology provides information about candidate causal genes in associated intervals and has direct implications for the understanding of complex diseases as well as the design of drugs to target disease pathways.},

Integrating external information such as quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of molecular traits (e.g. expression, methylation) is a powerful approach to identify the subset of GWAS signals explained by regulatory effects. In particular, expression QTLs (eQTLs) help pinpoint the responsible gene among the GWAS regions that harbor many genes, while methylation QTLs (mQTLs) help identify the epigenetic mechanisms that impact gene expression which in turn affect disease risk. In this work, we propose multiple-trait-coloc (moloc), a Bayesian statistical framework that integrates GWAS summary data with multiple molecular QTL data to identify regulatory effects at GWAS risk loci.},

  abstract = {Background: High hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) titers are generally associated with reduced influenza risk. While repeated influenza vaccination reduces seroresponse, vaccine effectiveness is not always reduced. Methods: During the 2007-2008 influenza season, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial (FLUVACS) evaluated the efficacies of live-attenuated (LAIV) and inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) among healthy adults aged 18-49 in Michigan; IIV vaccine efficacy (VE) and LAIV VE against influenza disease were estimated at 68\% and 36\%. Using the principal stratification/VE moderation framework, we analyzed data from this trial to assess how each VE varied by HAI or NAI responses to vaccination observed for vaccinated individuals and predicted counterfactually for placebo recipients. We also assessed how each VE varied with pre-vaccination/baseline variables including HAI titer, NAI titer, and vaccination history. Results: IIV VE appeared to increase with Day 30 post-vaccination HAI titer, albeit not significantly (p=0.20 and estimated VE 14.4\%, 70.5\%, and 85.5\% at titer below the assay lower quantification limit, 512, and 4096 (maximum)). Moreover, IIV VE increased significantly with Day 30 post-vaccination NAI titer (p=0.040), with estimated VE zero at titer 10 and 92.2\% at highest titer 640. There was no evidence that fold-change in post-vaccination HAI or NAI titer associated with IIV VE (p=0.76, 0.38). For LAIV, there was no evidence that VE associated with post-vaccination or fold-rise HAI or NAI titers (p-values {$>$}0.40). For IIV, VE increased with increasing baseline NAI titer in those previously vaccinated, but VE decreased with increasing baseline NAI titer in those previously unvaccinated. In contrast, for LAIV, VE did not depend on previous vaccination or baseline HAI or NAI titer. Conclusions: Future efficacy trials should measure baseline and post-vaccination antibody titers in both vaccine and control/placebo recipients, enabling analyses to better elucidate correlates of vaccine- and natural-protection.

Systematic searches for genes influencing complex disorders, including bipolar disorder, have recently been completed using whole genome association (WGA), identifying a series of validated loci. Using this information, it is possible to compare effect sizes of disease loci discovered in very large samples to the effect sizes of replicated functional loci determining intermediate phenotypes that are of essential interest in psychiatric disorders. It is shown that the genes influencing intermediate phenotypes tend to have a larger effect size. Furthermore, the WGA results reveal that the number of loci of large effect size for complex diseases is limited, and yet multiple functional loci have already been identified for intermediate phenotypes relevant to psychiatric diseases, and without the benefit of WGA.},

Autoimmune triggering has been added to clinical spectrum of this pathology, which is now known to be much broader than diarrhea. The impact of RV vaccines in these other conditions is becoming a growing field of research. The importance of host genetic background in RV susceptibility has been revealed, therefore increasing our understanding of vaccine effectiveness and giving some clues about the limited efficacy of RV vaccines in low-income settings. Also, interaction of RV with intestinal microbiota seems to play a key role in the process of infection vaccine effect. This article reviews current findings on the extraintestinal impact of RV infection and their widening clinical picture, and the recently described mechanisms of host susceptibility to infection and vaccine effectiveness. RV infection is a systemic disease with clinical and pathophysiological implications beyond the gut. We propose an “iceberg” model for this pathology with almost hidden clinical implications away from the gastrointestinal tract and eventually triggering the development of autoimmune diseases. Impact of current vaccines is being influenced by host genetics and gut microbiota interactions and these factors must be taken into account in the development of public health programs.},

  abstract = {Antibody repertoire diversity and plasticity is crucial for broad protective immunity. Repertoires change in size and diversity across multiple B cell developmental stages and in response to antigen exposure. However, we still lack fundamental quantitative understanding of the extent to which repertoire diversity is predetermined. Therefore, we implemented a systems immunology framework for quantifying repertoire predetermination on three distinct levels: (1) B cell development (pre-B cell, naive B cell, plasma cell), (2) antigen exposure (three structurally different proteins), and (3) four antibody repertoire components (V-gene usage, clonal expansion, clonal diversity, repertoire size) extracted from antibody repertoire sequencing data (400 million reads). Across all three levels, we detected a dynamic balance of high genetic (e.g., {$>$}90\% for V-gene usage and clonal expansion in naive B cells) and antigen-driven (e.g., 40\% for clonal diversity in plasma cells) predetermination and stochastic variation. Our study has implications for the prediction and manipulation of humoral immunity.},

The most common error is to follow the MANOVA with univariate analyses of the dependent variables. One reason for the occurrence of such errors is the lack of clear pedagogical materials for identifying and testing the multivariate effects from the analysis. The current paper consequently reviews the fundamental differences between MANOVA and univariate Analysis of Variance and then presents a coherent set of methods for plumbing the multivariate nature of a given data set. A completely worked example using genuine data is given along with estimates of effect sizes and confidence intervals, and an example results section following the technical writing style of the American Psychological Association is presented. A number of issues regarding the current methods are also discussed.},

  abstract = {Meta-analyses of clinical trials targeting rare events face particular challenges when the data lack adequate numbers of events for all treatment arms. Especially when the number of studies is low, standard meta-analysis methods can lead to serious distortions because of such data sparsity. To overcome this, we suggest the use of weakly informative priors (WIP) for the treatment effect parameter of a Bayesian meta-analysis model, which may also be seen as a form of penalization. As a data model, we use a binomial-normal hierarchical model (BNHM) which does not require continuity corrections in case of zero counts in one or both arms. We suggest a normal prior for the log odds ratio with mean 0 and standard deviation 2.82, which is motivated (1) as a symmetric prior centred around unity and constraining the odds ratio to within a range from 1/250 to 250 with 95 \% probability, and (2) as consistent with empirically observed effect estimates from a set of \$\textbackslash mbox\{\$37\textbackslash,773\$\}\$ meta-analyses from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. In a simulation study with rare events and few studies, our BNHM with a WIP outperformed a Bayesian method without a WIP and a maximum likelihood estimator in terms of smaller bias and shorter interval estimates with similar coverage. Furthermore, the methods are illustrated by a systematic review in immunosuppression of rare safety events following paediatric transplantation. A publicly available \$\textbackslash textbf\{R\}\$ package, \$\textbackslash texttt\{MetaStan\}\$, is developed to automate the \$\textbackslash textbf\{Stan\}\$ implementation of meta-analysis models using WIPs.},

Our understanding of the genetic determinants of disease risk has greatly advanced with the advent of genome-w ide association studies (GWAS), which detect associations between genetic variants and complex traits or diseases by comparing populations of cases and controls. However, much of this discovery has occurred through GWAS of individuals of European ancestry{$\mkern1mu$}, with limited representation of other populations, including from Africa, The Americas, Asia and Oceania. Population demography{$\mkern1mu$}, genetic drift and adaptation to environments over thousands of years have led globally to the diversification of populations. This global genomic diversity can provide new opportunities for discovery and translation into therapies, as well as a better understanding of population disease risk. Large-s cale multi-ethnic and representative biobanks and population health resources provide unprecedented opportunities to understand the genetic determinants of disease on a global scale.},

However, vaccines have historically been developed empirically, and recent development of vaccines against current pandemics such as HIV and malaria has been met with difficulty. The advent of high-throughput technologies, coupled with systems biological methods of data analysis, has enabled researchers to interrogate the entire complement of a variety of molecular components within cells, and characterize the myriad interactions among them in order to model and understand the behavior of the system as a whole. In the context of vaccinology, these tools permit exploration of the molecular mechanisms by which vaccines induce protective immune responses. Here we review the recent advances, challenges, and potential of systems biological approaches in vaccinology. If the challenges facing this developing field can be overcome, systems vaccinology promises to empower the identification of early predictive signatures of vaccine response, as well as novel and robust correlates of protection from infection. Such discoveries, along with the improved understanding of immune responses to vaccination they impart, will play an instrumental role in development of the next generation of rationally designed vaccines.},

  abstract = {Background There are insufficient system-wide transcriptomic (or other) data that help explain the observed inter-individual variability in antibody titers after measles vaccination in otherwise healthy individuals. Methods We performed a transcriptome(mRNA-Seq)-profiling study after in vitro viral stimulation of PBMCs from 30 measles vaccine recipients, selected from a cohort of 764 schoolchildren, based on the highest and lowest antibody titers. We used regression and network biology modeling to define markers associated with neutralizing antibody response. Results We identified 39 differentially expressed genes that demonstrate significant differences between the high and low antibody responder groups (p-value 0.0002, q-value 0.092), including the top gene CD93 (p{$<$}1.0E-13, q{$<$}1.0E-09), encoding a receptor required for antigen-driven B-cell differentiation, maintenance of immunoglobulin production and preservation of plasma cells in the bone marrow. Network biology modeling highlighted plasma cell survival (CD93, IL6, CXCL12), chemokine/cytokine activity and cell-cell communication/ adhesion/migration as biological processes associated with the observed differential response in the two responder groups. Conclusion We identified genes and pathways that explain in part, and are associated with, neutralizing antibody titers after measles vaccination. This new knowledge could assist in the},

This proof-of-concept, randomized-controlled, open-label trial tested if microbiome modulation can improve RVV immunogenicity. Healthy adults were randomized and administered broad-spectrum (oral vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, metronidazole), narrow-spectrum (vancomycin), or no antibiotics and then vaccinated with RVV, 21 per group per protocol. Baseline anti-RV IgA was high in all subjects. Although antibiotics did not alter absolute anti-RV IgA titers, RVV immunogenicity was boosted at 7 days in the narrow-spectrum group. Further, antibiotics increased fecal shedding of RV while also rapidly altering gut bacterial beta diversity. Beta diversity associated with RVV immunogenicity boosting at day 7 and specific bacterial taxa that distinguish RVV boosters and RV shedders were identified. Despite the negative primary endpoint, this study demonstrates that microbiota modification alters the immune response to RVV and supports further exploration of microbiome manipulation to improve RVV immunogenicity.},

Whilst LMMs offer a flexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the fitting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

Humans are exposed to a multitude of influenza viruses throughout their lifetime and it is clear that immune history influences the magnitude and quality of the antibody response.

Although this model has been challenged since its discovery, past exposure, and likely one’s first exposure, clearly affects the epitopes targeted in subsequent responses. Understanding how previous exposure to influenza virus shapes antibody responses to vaccination and infection is critical, especially with the prospect of future pandemics and for the effective development of a universal influenza vaccine.},

A problem associated with small meta-analyses is estimating the heterogeneity between trials. To overcome this problem, information from other related studies may be incorporated into the meta-analysis. A Bayesian approach to this problem is presented using data from previous meta-analyses in the same therapeutic area to formulate a prior distribution for the heterogeneity. The treatment difference parameters are given non-informative priors. Further, related trials which compare one or other of the treatments of interest with a common third treatment are included in the model to improve inference on both the heterogeneity and the treatment difference. Two approaches to estimating relative efficacy are considered, namely a general parametric approach and a method explicit to binary data. The methodology is illustrated using data from 26 clinical trials which investigate the prevention of cirrhosis using beta-blockers and sclerotherapy. Both sources of external information lead to more precise posterior distributions for all parameters, in particular that representing heterogeneity.},

Here we discuss the justification and interpretation of such models, by addressing in turn the aims of estimation, prediction and hypothesis testing. A particular issue that we consider is the distinction between inference on the mean of the random-effects distribution and inference on the whole distribution. We suggest that random-effects meta-analyses as currently conducted often fail to provide the key results, and we investigate the extent to which distribution-free, classical and Bayesian approaches can provide satisfactory methods. We conclude that the Bayesian approach has the advantage of naturally allowing for full uncertainty, especially for prediction. However, it is not without problems, including computational intensity and sensitivity to a priori judgements. We propose a simple prediction interval for classical meta-analysis and offer extensions to standard practice of Bayesian meta-analysis, making use of an example of studies of ‘set shifting’ ability in people with eating disorders.},

  abstract = {Annual influenza vaccinations are currently recommended for all individuals 6 months and older. Antibodies induced by vaccination are an important mechanism of protection against infection. Despite the overall public health success of influenza vaccination, many individuals fail to induce a substantial antibody response. Systems-level immune profiling studies have discerned associations between transcriptional and cell subset signatures with the success of antibody responses. However, existing signatures have relied on small cohorts and have not been validated in large independent studies. We leveraged multiple influenza vaccination cohorts spanning distinct geographical locations and seasons from the Human Immunology Project Consortium (HIPC) and the Center for Human Immunology (CHI) to identify baseline (i.e., before vaccination) predictive transcriptional signatures of influenza vaccination responses. Our multicohort analysis of HIPC data identified nine genes (RAB24, GRB2, DPP3, ACTB, MVP, DPP7, ARPC4, PLEKHB2, and ARRB1) and three gene modules that were significantly associated with the magnitude of the antibody response, and these associations were validated in the independent CHI cohort. These signatures were specific to young individuals, suggesting that distinct mechanisms underlie the lower vaccine response in older individuals. We found an inverse correlation between the effect size of signatures in young and older individuals. Although the presence of an inflammatory gene signature, for example, was associated with better antibody responses in young individuals, it was associated with worse responses in older individuals. These results point to the prospect of predicting antibody responses before vaccination and provide insights into the biological mechanisms underlying successful vaccination responses.},

  abstract = {Most common diseases are complex genetic traits, with multiple genetic and environmental components contributing to susceptibility. It has been proposed that common genetic variants, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), influence susceptibility to common disease. This proposal has begun to be tested in numerous studies of association between genetic variation at these common DNA polymorphisms and variation in disease susceptibility. We have performed an extensive review of such association studies. We find that over 600 positive associations between common gene variants and disease have been reported; these associations, if correct, would have tremendous importance for the prevention, prediction, and treatment of most common diseases. However, most reported associations are not robust: of the 166 putative associations which have been studied three or more times, only 6 have been consistently replicated. Interestingly, of the remaining 160 associations, well over half were observed again one or more times. We discuss the possible reasons for this irreproducibility and suggest guidelines for performing and interpreting genetic association studies. In particular, we emphasize the need for caution in drawing conclusions from a single report of an association between a genetic variant and disease susceptibility. Genet Med 2002:4(2):45–61.},

Results: We describe a statistical and visualization framework, variancePartition, to prioritize drivers of variation based on a genome-wide summary, and identify genes that deviate from the genome-wide trend. Using a linear mixed model, variancePartition quantifies variation in each expression trait attributable to differences in disease status, sex, cell or tissue type, ancestry, genetic background, experimental stimulus, or technical variables. Analysis of four large-scale transcriptome profiling datasets illustrates that variancePartition recovers striking patterns of biological and technical variation that are reproducible across multiple datasets. Conclusions: Our open source software, variancePartition, enables rapid interpretation of complex gene expression studies as well as other high-throughput genomics assays. variancePartition is available from Bioconductor: http://bioconductor.org/packages/variancePartition.},

However, the impact, interplay, and underlying biological mechanisms among BMI, environment, genetics, and ancestry are not completely understood. To further examine these relationships, we utilized 427,509 calendar year-averaged BMI measurements from 100,418 adults from the single large multiethnic Genetic Epidemiology Research on Adult Health and Aging (GERA) cohort. We observed substantial independent ancestry and nationality differences, including ancestry principal component interactions and nonlinear effects. To increase the list of BMI-associated variants before assessing other differences, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in GERA, with replication in the Genetic Investigation of Anthropomorphic Traits (GIANT) consortium combined with the UK Biobank (UKB), followed by GWAS in GERA combined with GIANT, with replication in the UKB. We discovered 30 novel independent BMI loci (P , 5.0 3 1028) that replicated. We then assessed the proportion of BMI variance explained by sex in the UKB using previously identified loci compared to previously and newly identified loci and found slight increases: from 3.0 to 3.3\% for males and from 2.7 to 3.0\% for females. Further, the variance explained by previously and newly identified variants decreased with increasing age in the GERA and UKB cohorts, echoed in the variance explained by the entire genome, which also showed gene–age interaction effects. Finally, we conducted a tissue expression QTL enrichment analysis, which revealed that GWAS BMI-associated variants were enriched in the cerebellum, consistent with prior work in humans and mice.},

Estimates of FST can identify regions of the genome that have been the target of selection, and comparisons of FST from different parts of the genome can provide insights into the demographic history of populations. For these reasons and others, FST has a central role in population and evolutionary genetics and has wide applications in fields that range from disease association mapping to forensic science.

  abstract = {Summary: While meta-analysis provides a powerful tool for analyzing microarray experiments by combining data from multiple studies, it presents unique computational challenges. The Bioconductor package RankProd provides a new and intuitive tool for this purpose in detecting differentially expressed genes under two experimental conditions. The package modifies and extends the rank product method proposed by Breitling et al., [(2004) FEBS Lett., 573, 83–92] to integrate multiple microarray studies from different laboratories and/or platforms. It offers several advantages over t-test based methods and accepts pre-processed expression datasets produced from a wide variety of platforms. The significance of the detection is assessed by a non-parametric permutation test, and the associated P-value and false discovery rate (FDR) are included in the output alongside the genes that are detected by user-defined criteria. A visualization plot is provided to view actual expression levels for each gene with estimated significance measurements.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and subsequent dense-genotyping of associated loci identified over a hundred single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants associated with the risk of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), type 1 diabetes (T1D), and celiac disease (CeD). Immunological and genetic studies suggest a role for CD4-positive effector memory T (CD+ TEM) cells in the pathogenesis of these diseases. To elucidate mechanisms of autoimmune disease alleles, we investigated molecular phenotypes in CD4+ effector memory T cells potentially affected by these variants. In a cohort of genotyped healthy individuals, we isolated high purity CD4+ TEM cells from peripheral blood, then assayed relative abundance, proliferation upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, and the transcription of 215 genes within disease loci before and after stimulation. We identified 46 genes regulated by cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL), the majority of which we detected in stimulated cells. Eleven of the 46 genes with eQTLs were previously undetected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Of 96 risk alleles of RA, T1D, and/or CeD in densely genotyped loci, eleven overlapped cis-eQTLs, of which five alleles completely explained the respective signals. A non-coding variant, rs389862A, increased proliferative response (p = 4.7561028). In addition, baseline expression of seventeen genes in resting cells reliably predicted proliferative response after TCR stimulation. Strikingly, however, there was no evidence that risk alleles modulated CD4+ TEM abundance or proliferation. Our study underscores the power of examining molecular phenotypes in relevant cells and conditions for understanding pathogenic mechanisms of disease variants.},

Genome-wide association studies have identified 200 inflammatory bowel disease-associated loci, but few have been conclusively resolved to specific functional variants. Here we report fine-mapping of 94 inflammatory bowel disease loci using high-density genotyping in 67,852 individuals. We pinpoint 18 associations to a single causal variant with greater than 95\% certainty, and an additional 27 associations to a single variant with greater than 50\% certainty. These 45 variants are significantly enriched for protein-coding changes (n\,=\,13), direct disruption of transcription-factor binding sites (n\,=\,3), and tissue-specific epigenetic marks (n\,=\,10), with the last category showing enrichment in specific immune cells among associations stronger in Crohn's disease and in gut mucosa among associations stronger in ulcerative colitis. The results of this study suggest that high-resolution fine-mapping in large samples can convert many discoveries from genome-wide association studies into statistically convincing causal variants, providing a powerful substrate for experimental elucidation of disease mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Human complex traits and diseases are often highly polygenic. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been successful in identifying the underlying genetic components. However, challenges still remain and one of them is the biological interpretation of these findings. Genetic variants that are associated with diseases or traits are enriched in regulatory regions of the genome, suggesting that they may have a role in the regulation of intermediate molecular phenotypes, such as mRNA gene expression. Studies investigating the genetic architecture of gene expression variation, or expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), have aided the interpretation of GWAS findings by providing potential mechanisms through which the genetic variants contribute to higher-order phenotypes. In addition, eQTLs identified in disease-relevant tissues, or those that are specific to certain cell types or conditions are more informative in disease pathogenesis. This thesis first explored eQTL study design and analysis choices using extensive, empirically driven simulations with varying sample sizes, true effect sizes, and allele frequencies of true eQTLs. False discovery rate (FDR) control applied to the entire collection of tests had inflated FDR of genes with eQTLs (eGenes) in most scenarios; in contrast, hierarchical correction procedures had well-calibrated FDR. Significant eQTLs with low allele frequencies identified using small sample sizes were enriched for false positives. Overestimation of eQTL effect sizes was common in scenarios with low statistical power, and a bootstrap method (BootstrapQTL) which can lead to more accurate effect size estimation was developed. Based on the insights of the eQTL simulation study, optimal strategies were selected for the following eQTL analysis in two types of neonatal immune cells (monocytes and T cells) under resting and stimulated conditions. A great proportion of cis-eQTLs were specific to a certain cell type or condition, and the majority of them were observed only upon stimulation. Response eQTLs (reQTLs), with effects on gene expression modified by immune responses, were identified for 31\% of the eGenes in monocytes and 52\% of the eGenes in T cells. Trans-eQTL effects that were mediated through expression of cis-eGenes were observed. Lastly, integrative analyses were performed, using the early-life eQTLs, as well as GWAS variants associated with immune-related diseases obtained from external large cohorts. Significant overlaps between neonatal eQTLs and postnatal disease-associated variants were observed. Some cell type- or condition-specific cis-eQTLs colocalised with disease associations, suggesting that the potential risk genes involved in disease pathogenesis are linked to the stimulation of certain immune cells. Causal effects of genes were evaluated using Mendelian randomisation, and changes in expression levels (e.g. BTN3A2) were identified to have causal associations with multiple immune-related diseases. Taken together, it demonstrates that the early-life genetic variants and gene expression might contribute to later disease development. In conclusion, this thesis provides a strong evidence base for eQTL study design and guidance for analysis strategies in future studies. The characterisation of genetic regulation of neonatal immune responses and the interaction between regulatory variants and stimulatory conditions is a useful resource, and generates insights on the early-life origins of immune-related diseases that develop later in life.},

  abstract = {Chronic immune-mediated diseases of adulthood often originate in early childhood. To investigate genetic associations between neonatal immunity and disease, we collected cord blood samples from a birth cohort and mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in resting monocytes and CD4+ T cells as well as in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or phytohemagglutinin (PHA) stimulation, respectively. Cis-eQTLs were largely specific to cell type or stimulation, and response eQTLs were identified for 31\% of genes with cis-eQTLs (eGenes) in monocytes and 52\% of eGenes in CD4+ T cells. We identified trans-eQTLs and mapped cis regulatory factors which act as mediators of trans effects. There was extensive colocalisation of causal variants for cell type- and stimulation-specific neonatal cis-eQTLs and those of autoimmune and allergic diseases, in particular CTSH (Cathepsin H) which showed widespread colocalisation across diseases. Mendelian randomisation showed causal neonatal gene transcription effects on disease risk for BTN3A2, HLA-C and many other genes. Our study elucidates the genetics of gene expression in neonatal conditions and cell types as well as the aetiological origins of autoimmune and allergic diseases.},

In particular, we derive a transformation h for intensity measurements, and a difference statistic h whose variance is approximately constant along the whole intensity range. This forms a basis for statistical inference from microarray data, and provides a rational data pre-processing strategy for multivariate analyses. For the transformation h, the parametric form h(x) = arsinh(a + bx) is derived from a model of the variance-versus-mean dependence for microarray intensity data, using the method of variance stabilizing transformations. For large intensities, h coincides with the logarithmic transformation, and h with the log-ratio. The parameters of h together with those of the calibration between experiments are estimated with a robust variant of maximum-likelihood estimation. We demonstrate our approach on data sets from different experimental platforms, including two-colour cDNA arrays and a series of Affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays.},

Focusing on variant-level colocalization approaches, we first establish the connections between various existing methods. We proceed to discuss the impacts of various controllable analytical factors and uncontrollable practical factors on outcomes of colocalization analysis through realistic simulations and real data examples. We identify a single analytical factor, the specification of prior enrichment levels, which can lead to severe inflation of false-positive colocalization findings. Meanwhile, the combination of many other analytical and practical factors all lead to diminished power. Consequently, we recommend the following strategies for the best practice of colocalization analysis: i) estimating prior enrichment level from the observed data; and ii) separating fine-mapping and colocalization analysis. Our analysis of 4,091 complex traits and the multi-tissue eQTL data from the GTEx (version 8) suggests that colocalizations of molecular QTLs and GWAS traits are widespread in many complex traits. However, only a small proportion can be confidently identified from currently available data due to a lack of power. Our findings should serve as an important benchmark for the current and future integrative genetic association analysis applications.},

Meta-analysis combining multiple transcriptomic studies can increase statistical power to detect disease related biomarkers. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian latent hierarchical model to perform transcriptomic meta-analysis. This method is capable of detecting genes that are differentially expressed (DE) in only a subset of the combined studies, and the latent variables help quantify homogeneous and heterogeneous differential expression signals across studies. A tight clustering algorithm is applied to detected biomarkers to capture differential meta-patterns that are informative to guide further biological investigation. Simulations and three examples including a microarray dataset from metabolism related knockout mice, an RNA-seq dataset from HIV transgenic rats and cross-platforms datasets from human breast cancer are used to demonstrate performance of the proposed method.},

Understanding how and why selection acts has important potential applications, from understanding the mechanisms of disease and microbial resistance, to improving the design of transgenes and drugs.},

Many researchers use mean centered variables because they believe it’s the thing to do or because reviewers ask them to, without quite understanding why. Adding to the confusion is the fact that there is also a perspective in the literature that mean centering does not reduce multicollinearity. In this article, we clarify the issues and reconcile the discrepancy. We distinguish between Bmicro\^ and Bmacro\^ definitions of multicollinearity and show how both sides of such a debate can be correct. To do so, we use proofs, an illustrative dataset, and a Monte Carlo simulation to show the precise effects of mean centering on both individual correlation coefficients as well as overall model indices. We hope to contribute to the literature by clarifying the issues, reconciling the two perspectives, and quelling the current confusion regarding whether and how mean centering can be a useful practice.},

  abstract = {Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic complex disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with IBD can experience a wide range of symptoms, but the pathophysiological mechanisms that cause these individual differences in clinical presentation remain largely unknown. In consequence, IBD is currently classified into subtypes using clinical characteristics. If we are to develop a more targeted treatment approach, molecular subtypes of IBD need to be discovered that can be used as new drug targets. To achieve this, we need multiple layers of molecular data generated from the same IBD patients. Construction and content: We initiated the 1000IBD project (https://1000ibd.org) to prospectively follow more than 1000 IBD patients from the Northern provinces of the Netherlands. For these patients, we have collected a uniquely large number of phenotypes and generated multi-omics profiles. To date, 1215 participants have been enrolled in the project and enrolment is on-going. Phenotype data collected for these participants includes information on dietary and environmental factors, drug responses and adverse drug events. Genome information has been generated using genotyping (ImmunoChip, Global Screening Array and HumanExomeChip) and sequencing (whole exome sequencing and targeted resequencing of IBD susceptibility loci), transcriptome information generated using RNA-sequencing of intestinal biopsies and microbiome information generated using both sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene and whole genome shotgun metagenomic sequencing.},

Here, we performed a systematic analysis of all GWASs published in two recent but nonconsecutive periods to assess whether any consensus was emerging regarding the choice of these thresholds. Study Design and Setting: We identified 167 GWASs published during the first semester of 2011 and 105 published in the third trimester of 2012 and retrieved the genome-wide threshold of significance and the thresholds to include SNPs in a replication stage if applicable. Results: The proportion of studies using 5 Â 10À8 as a genome-wide significance threshold increased between 2011 and 2012 (40\% vs. 64\%, P ! 0.001), whereas the proportion of articles that gave a justification for this threshold decreased. The distribution of thresholds used to include SNPs in the replication stage remained stable over time (median 10À5), and the variance remained large [interquartile range (10À6, 10À4)]. Conclusion: Although 5 Â 10À8 has become the de facto standard genome-wide threshold, practice regarding the choice of inclusion threshold for the replication step remains heterogeneous and did not ensure the best trade-off between power and type 1 error.

  abstract = {The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) is commonly used for assessing the discriminative ability of prediction models even though the measure is criticized for being clinically irrelevant and lacking an intuitive interpretation. Every tutorial explains how the coordinates of the ROC curve are obtained from the risk distributions of diseased and non-diseased individuals, but it has not become common sense that therewith the ROC plot is just another way of presenting these risk distributions. We show how the ROC curve is an alternative way to present risk distributions of diseased and non-diseased individuals and how the shape of the ROC curve informs about the overlap of the risk distributions. For example, ROC curves are rounded when the prediction model included variables with similar effect on disease risk and have an angle when, for example, one binary risk factor has a stronger effect; and ROC curves are stepped rather than smooth when the sample size or incidence is low, when the prediction model is based on a relatively small set of categorical predictors. This alternative perspective on the ROC plot invalidates most purported limitations of the AUC and attributes others to the underlying risk distributions. AUC is a measure of the discriminative ability of prediction models. The assessment of prediction models should be supplemented with other metrics to assess their clinical utility.},

The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( {$>$} 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

VE tended to decline in the second year of life, particularly in medium and high mortality settings, and tended to be greater against more severe rotavirus disease.

  abstract = {Autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and coeliac disease are typical examples of complex genetic diseases caused by a combination of genetic and non-genetic risk factors. Insight into the genetic risk factors (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)) has increased since genome-wide association studies (GWAS) became possible in 2007 and, for individual diseases, SNPs can now explain some 15–50\% of genetic risk. GWAS have also shown that some 50\% of the genetic risk factors for individual autoimmune diseases overlap between different diseases. Thus, shared risk factors may converge to pathways that, when perturbed by genetic variation, predispose to autoimmunity in general. This raises the question of what determines disease specificity, and suggests that identical risk factors may have different effects in various autoimmune diseases. Addressing this question requires translation of genetic risk factors to causal genes and then to molecular and cellular pathways. Since {$>$}90\% of the genetic risk factors are found in the non-coding part of the genome (i.e. outside the exons of proteincoding genes) and can have an impact on gene regulation, there is an urgent need to better understand the non-coding part of the genome. Here, we will outline the methods being used to unravel the gene regulatory networks perturbed in autoimmune diseases and the importance of doing this in the relevant cell types. We will highlight findings in coeliac disease, which manifests in the small intestine, to demonstrate how cell type and disease context can impact on the consequences of genetic risk factors.},

  abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, the two common forms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), affect over 2.5 million people of European ancestry, with rising prevalence in other populations. Genome-wide association studies and subsequent meta-analyses of these two diseases as separate phenotypes have implicated previously unsuspected mechanisms, such as autophagy, in their pathogenesis and showed that some IBD loci are shared with other inflammatory diseases. Here we expand on the knowledge of relevant pathways by undertaking a meta-analysis of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis genome-wide association scans, followed by extensive validation of significant findings, with a combined total of more than 75,000 cases and controls. We identify 71 new associations, for a total of 163 IBD loci, that meet genome-wide significance thresholds. Most loci contribute to both phenotypes, and both directional (consistently favouring one allele over the course of human history) and balancing (favouring the retention of both alleles within populations) selection effects are evident. Many IBD loci are also implicated in other immune-mediated disorders, most notably with ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis. We also observe considerable overlap between susceptibility loci for IBD and mycobacterial infection. Gene co-expression network analysis emphasizes this relationship, with pathways shared between host responses to mycobacteria and those predisposing to IBD.},

  abstract = {Bisphenol A (BPA) is an endocrine-disrupting chemical that is related to many diseases, including heart attacks and diabetes. Recently, several studies have reported the carcinogenic potential of BPA in rodents, yet carcinogenic effects of BPA in humans remains unclear. In this study, meta-analysis was app­ lied to independent GEO datasets, based on 158 Affymetrix microarrays and 8 Illumina RNA-Seqs. Additionally, we performed functional enrichment analysis, disease similarity analysis based on Disease Ontology (DO) analysis, and network analysis. 1,993 (1,457 up-, 536 down-regulated) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from five GEO datasets by adjusting for batch effects. Using disease similarity analysis, we demonstrated that results of DO analysis of the top 20 diseases were highly related to breast cancer. Moreover, we showed that the DEGs were significantly enriched in gene expression datasets on human breast cancer tissue via gene set enrichment analysis. By performing network analysis, we finally identified 85 (68 up- and 17 down-regulated) DEGs, and some of their expression levels were validated by quantitative PCR. The identified DEGs were regarded as genetic markers for carcinogenic risks, indicating that BPA may be a potential carcinogenic chemical contributing to the cause of breast cancer in humans.},

Recent discoveries have provided insights into TNF biology that introduce new concepts for the development of therapeutics for TNF-mediated diseases. The model of TNF receptor signalling has been extended to include linear ubiquitination and the formation of distinct signalling complexes that are linked with different functional outcomes, such as inflammation, apoptosis and necroptosis. Our understanding of TNF-induced gene expression has been enriched by the discovery of epigenetic mechanisms and concepts related to cellular priming, tolerization and induction of ‘short-term transcriptional memory’. Identification of distinct homeostatic or pathogenic TNF-induced signalling pathways has introduced the concept of selectively inhibiting the deleterious effects of TNF while preserving its homeostatic bioactivities for therapeutic purposes. In this Review, we present molecular mechanisms underlying the roles of TNF in homeostasis and inflammatory disease pathogenesis, and discuss novel strategies to advance therapeutic paradigms for the treatment of TNF-mediated diseases.},

  abstract = {Genomewide association mapping in model organisms such as inbred mouse strains is a promising approach for the identification of risk factors related to human diseases. However, genetic association studies in inbred model organisms are confronted by the problem of complex population structure among strains. This induces inflated false positive rates, which cannot be corrected using standard approaches applied in human association studies such as genomic control or structured association. Recent studies demonstrated that mixed models successfully correct for the genetic relatedness in association mapping in maize and Arabidopsis panel data sets. However, the currently available mixed-model methods suffer from computational inefficiency. In this article, we propose a new method, efficient mixed-model association (EMMA), which corrects for population structure and genetic relatedness in model organism association mapping. Our method takes advantage of the specific nature of the optimization problem in applying mixed models for association mapping, which allows us to substantially increase the computational speed and reliability of the results. We applied EMMA to in silico whole-genome association mapping of inbred mouse strains involving hundreds of thousands of SNPs, in addition to Arabidopsis and maize data sets. We also performed extensive simulation studies to estimate the statistical power of EMMA under various SNP effects, varying degrees of population structure, and differing numbers of multiple measurements per strain. Despite the limited power of inbred mouse association mapping due to the limited number of available inbred strains, we are able to identify significantly associated SNPs, which fall into known QTL or genes identified through previous studies while avoiding an inflation of false positives. An R package implementation and webserver of our EMMA method are publicly available.},

The performance of each procedure was judged by the percentage of the number of times that the procedure was correct and the mean components that each procedure extracted in each cell. Generally, the results show that when component loading was high, an increase in reliability resulted in an improvement of the accuracy of parallel analysis and modified horn’s parallel analysis.},

In order to characterize the genetic basis of variation in the immunomodulatory effects of 1,25D, we mapped quantitative traits of 1,25D response at both the cellular and the transcriptional level. We carried out a genome-wide association scan of percent inhibition of cell proliferation (Imax) induced by 1,25D treatment of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 88 healthy African-American individuals. Two genome-wide significant variants were identified: rs1893662 in a gene desert on chromosome 18 (p = 2.32 x 10−8) and rs6451692 on chromosome 5 (p = 2.55 x 10−8), which may influence the anti-proliferative activity of 1,25D by regulating the expression of nearby genes such as the chemokine gene, CCL28, and the translation initiation gene, PAIP1. We also identified 8 expression quantitative trait loci at a FDR{$<$}0.10 for transcriptional response to 1,25D treatment, which include the transcriptional regulator ets variant 3-like (ETV3L) and EH-domain containing 4 (EHD4). In addition, we identified response eQTLs in vitamin D receptor binding sites near genes differentially expressed in response to 1,25D, such as FERM Domain Containing 6 (FRMD6), which plays a critical role in regulating both cell proliferation and apoptosis. Combining information from the GWAS of Imax and the response eQTL mapping enabled identification of putative Imax-associated candidate genes such as PAIP1 and the transcriptional repressor gene ZNF649. Overall, the variants identified in this study are strong candidates for immune traits and diseases linked to vitamin D, such as multiple sclerosis.},

Studies on disease-associated genetic polymorphisms have highlighted the importance of biological context for many regulatory variants, which is particularly relevant in understanding the genetic regulation of the immune system and its cellular phenotypes. Here we show cell type-specific regulation of transcript levels of genes associated with several autoimmune diseases in CD4+ and CD8+ T cells including a trans-acting regulatory locus at chr12q13.2 containing the rs1131017 SNP in the RPS26 gene. Most remarkably, we identify a common missense variant in IL27, associated with type 1 diabetes that results in decreased functional activity of the protein and reduced expression levels of downstream IRF1 and STAT1 in CD4+ T cells only. Altogether, our results indicate that eQTL mapping in purified T cells provides novel functional insights into polymorphisms and pathways associated with autoimmune diseases.},

  abstract = {A common causal identification strategy in political science is selection on observables. This strategy assumes one observes a set of covariates that is, after statistical adjustment, sufficient to make treatment status as-if random. Under adjustment methods such as matching or inverse probability weighting, coefficients for control variables are treated as nuisance parameters and are not directly estimated. This is in direct contrast to regression approaches where estimated parameters are obtained for all covariates. Analysts often find it tempting to give a causal interpretation to all the parameters in such regression models—indeed, such interpretations are often central to the proposed research design. In this paper, we ask when we can justify interpreting two or more coefficients in a regression model as causal parameters. We demonstrate that analysts must appeal to causal identification assumptions to give estimates causal interpretations. Under selection on observables, this task is complicated by the fact that more than one causal effect might be identified. We show how causal graphs provide a framework for clearly delineating which effects are presumed to be identified and thus merit a causal interpretation, and which are not. We conclude with a set of recommendations for how researchers should interpret estimates from regression models when causal inference is the goal.},

However, variable genetic and phenotypic characterisation of many existing iPSC lines limits their potential use for research and therapy. Here, we describe the systematic generation, genotyping and phenotyping of 522 open access human iPSCs derived from 189 healthy male and female individuals as part of the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Initiative (HipSci: http://www.hipsci.org). Our study provides a comprehensive picture of the major sources of genetic and phenotypic variation in iPSCs and establishes their suitability for use in genetic studies of complex human traits and cancer. Using a combination of genome-wide analyses we find that 5-25\% of the variation in different iPSC phenotypes, including differentiation capacity and cellular morphology, arises from differences between individuals. We also assess the phenotypic effects of rare, genomic copy number mutations that are recurrently seen following iPSC reprogramming and present an initial map of common regulatory variants affecting the transcriptome of pluripotent cells in humans.},

  abstract = {Current catalogs of brain expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) are incomplete and the findings do not replicate well across studies. All existing cortical eQTL studies are small and emphasize the need for a meta-analysis. We performed a meta-analysis of 424 brain samples across five studies to identify regulatory variants influencing gene expression in human cortex. We identified 3584 genes in autosomes and chromosome X with false discovery rate q{$<$}0.05 whose expression was significantly associated with DNA sequence variation. Consistent with previous eQTL studies, local regulatory variants tended to occur symmetrically around transcription start sites and the effect was more evident in studies with large sample sizes. In contrast to random SNPs, we observed that significant eQTLs were more likely to be near 5'-untranslated regions and intersect with regulatory features. Permutation-based enrichment analysis revealed that SNPs associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were enriched among brain eQTLs. Genes with significant eQTL evidence were also strongly associated with diseases from OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) and the NHGRI (National Human Genome Research Institute) genome-wide association study catalog. Surprisingly, we found that a large proportion (28\%) of \textasciitilde 1000 autosomal genes encoding proteins needed for mitochondrial structure or function were eQTLs (enrichment P-value=1.3 × 10(-9)), suggesting a potential role for common genetic variation influencing the robustness of energy supply in brain and a possible role in the etiology of some psychiatric disorders. These systematically generated eQTL information should be a valuable resource in determining the functional mechanisms of brain gene expression and the underlying biology of associations with psychiatric disorders.},

The organization of accessible chromatin across the genome reflects a network of permissible physical interactions through which enhancers, promoters, insulators and chromatin-b inding factors cooperatively regulate gene expression. This landscape of accessibility changes dynamically in response to both external stimuli and developmental cues, and emerging evidence suggests that homeostatic maintenance of accessibility is itself dynamically regulated through a competitive interplay between chromatin-binding factors and nucleosomes. In this Review{$\mkern1mu$}, we examine how the accessible genome is measured and explore the role of transcription factors in initiating accessibility remodelling; our goal is to illustrate how chromatin accessibility defines regulatory elements within the genome and how these epigenetic features are dynamically established to control gene expression.},

These methods are essential not only for virus characterization but also for identifying new antigenic variants, vaccine strain selection, and sero-epidemiologic studies of influenza virus transmission and prevalence. Virus titration methods such as the hemagglutination assay, 50\% egg or tissue culture infectious dose, and plaque assay are employed to determine the amount of virus particles in a sample. The hemagglutination inhibition assay is a reliable, relatively simple and inexpensive technique to antigenically characterize isolates of influenza viruses. Serological methods such as virus neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition are the fundamental tools used in sero-epidemiologic studies of influenza virus transmission and prevalence and in the evaluation of vaccine immunogenicity. While serological methods rarely yield an early diagnosis of acute influenza virus infection, well-timed, paired acute, and convalescent serum samples may establish the diagnosis of a recent influenza infection even when attempts to detect the virus are negative.},

  abstract = {Background: Heterogeneity has a key role in meta-analysis methods and can greatly affect conclusions. However, true levels of heterogeneity are unknown and often researchers assume homogeneity. We aim to: a) investigate the prevalence of unobserved heterogeneity and the validity of the assumption of homogeneity; b) assess the performance of various metaanalysis methods; c) apply the findings to published meta-analyses. Methods and Findings: We accessed 57,397 meta-analyses, available in the Cochrane Library in August 2012. Using simulated data we assessed the performance of various meta-analysis methods in different scenarios. The prevalence of a zero heterogeneity estimate in the simulated scenarios was compared with that in the Cochrane data, to estimate the degree of unobserved heterogeneity in the latter. We re-analysed all meta-analyses using all methods and assessed the sensitivity of the statistical conclusions. Levels of unobserved heterogeneity in the Cochrane data appeared to be high, especially for small meta-analyses. A bootstrapped version of the DerSimonian-Laird approach performed best in both detecting heterogeneity and in returning more accurate overall effect estimates. Re-analysing all meta-analyses with this new method we found that in cases where heterogeneity had originally been detected but ignored, 17–20\% of the statistical conclusions changed. Rates were much lower where the original analysis did not detect heterogeneity or took it into account, between 1\% and 3\%. Conclusions: When evidence for heterogeneity is lacking, standard practice is to assume homogeneity and apply a simpler fixed-effect meta-analysis. We find that assuming homogeneity often results in a misleading analysis, since heterogeneity is very likely present but undetected. Our new method represents a small improvement but the problem largely remains, especially for very small meta-analyses. One solution is to test the sensitivity of the meta-analysis conclusions to assumed moderate and large degrees of heterogeneity. Equally, whenever heterogeneity is detected, it should not be ignored.},

  abstract = {Background: In high-throughput studies, hundreds to millions of hypotheses are typically tested. Statistical methods that control the false discovery rate (FDR) have emerged as popular and powerful tools for error rate control. While classic FDR methods use only p-values as input, more modern FDR methods have been shown to increase power by incorporating complementary information as “informative covariates” to prioritize, weight, and group hypotheses. However, there is currently no consensus on how the modern methods compare to one another. We investigated the accuracy, applicability, and ease of use of two classic and six modern FDR-controlling methods by performing a systematic benchmark comparison using simulation studies as well as six case studies in computational biology. Results: Methods that incorporate informative covariates were modestly more powerful than classic approaches, and did not underperform classic approaches, even when the covariate was completely uninformative. The majority of methods were successful at controlling the FDR, with the exception of two modern methods under certain settings. Furthermore, we found the improvement of the modern FDR methods over the classic methods increased with the informativeness of the covariate, total number of hypothesis tests, and proportion of truly non-null hypotheses. Conclusions: Modern FDR methods that use an informative covariate provide advantages over classic FDR-controlling procedures, with the relative gain dependent on the application and informativeness of available covariates. We present our findings as a practical guide and provide recommendations to aid researchers in their choice of methods to correct for false discoveries.},

  abstract = {Influenza is an infectious respiratory disease that, in humans, is caused by influenza A and influenza B viruses. Typically characterized by annual seasonal epidemics, sporadic pandemic outbreaks involve influenza A virus strains of zoonotic origin. The WHO estimates that annual epidemics of influenza result in \textasciitilde 1 billion infections, 3–5 million cases of severe illness and 300,000–500,000 deaths. The severity of pandemic influenza depends on multiple factors, including the virulence of the pandemic virus strain and the level of pre-e xisting immunity. The most severe influenza pandemic, in 1918, resulted in\,{$>$}40 million deaths worldwide. Influenza vaccines are formulated every year to match the circulating strains, as they evolve antigenically owing to antigenic drift. Nevertheless, vaccine efficacy is not optimal and is dramatically low in the case of an antigenic mismatch between the vaccine and the circulating virus strain. Antiviral agents that target the influenza virus enzyme neuraminidase have been developed for prophylaxis and therapy. However, the use of these antivirals is still limited. Emerging approaches to combat influenza include the development of universal influenza virus vaccines that provide protection against antigenically distant influenza viruses, but these vaccines need to be tested in clinical trials to ascertain their effectiveness.},

Here we use data from the BLUEPRINT project to identify regulatory quantitative trait loci (QTL) for three primary human immune cell types and use these to fine-map putative causal variants for twelve immune-mediated diseases. We identify 340 unique, non major histocompatibility complex (MHC) disease loci that colocalise with high ({$>$}98\%) posterior probability with regulatory QTLs, and apply Bayesian frameworks to fine-map associations at each locus. We show that fine-mapping applied to regulatory QTLs yields smaller credible set sizes and higher posterior probabilities for candidate causal variants compared to disease summary statistics. We also describe a systematic under-representation of insertion/deletion (INDEL) polymorphisms in credible sets derived from publicly available disease meta-analysis when compared to QTLs based on genome-sequencing data. Overall, our findings suggest that fine-mapping applied to disease-colocalising regulatory QTLs can enhance the discovery of putative causal disease variants and provide insights into the underlying causal genes and molecular mechanisms.},

When proposing alternatives to p-values statisticians often commit the ‘Statistician’s Fallacy’, where they declare which statistic researchers really ‘want to know’. Instead of telling researchers what they want to know, statisticians should teach researchers which questions they can ask. In some situations, the answer to the question they are most interested in will be the p-value. There is clear room for improvement in how we teach p-values. If anyone really believes p-values are an important cause of problems in science, preventing the misinterpretation of p-values by developing better evidence-based education and user-centered statistical software should be a top priority. At least for some research questions we might not need alternatives to p-values, but can improve our inferences more by using alternatives to null-hypothesis tests. As long as null-hypothesis tests have been criticized, researchers have suggested to include minimal-effects tests and equivalence tests in our statistical toolbox, and these tests have the potential to greatly improve the questions researchers ask.},

  abstract = {Background: The clinical effectiveness of monovalent influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines has not been comprehensively summarised. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess vaccine effectiveness (VE) for adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccines. Methods: We searched healthcare databases and grey literature from 11 June 2009 to 12 November 2014. Two researchers independently assessed titles and abstracts to identify studies for full review. Random effects meta-analyses estimated the pooled effect size of vaccination compared to placebo or no vaccination for crude and adjusted odds ratios (OR) to prevent laboratory confirmed influenza illness (LCI) and related hospitalization. VE was calculated as (1-pooled OR) ⁄ 100. Narrative synthesis was undertaken where meta-analysis was not possible. Results: We identified 9229 studies of which 38 at moderate risk of bias met protocol eligibility criteria; 23 were suitable for meta-analysis. Pooled adjusted VE against LCI with adjuvanted and unadjuvanted vaccines both reached statistical significance (adjuvanted: VE = 80\%; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 59–90\%; unadjuvanted: VE = 66\%; 95\% CI 47–78\%); in planned secondary analyses, VE in adults often failed to reach statistical significance and pooled point estimates were lower than observed in children. Overall pooled adjusted VE against hospitalization was 61\% (95\% CI 14–82\%); in planned secondary analyses, adjusted VE attained statistical significance in adults aged 18–64 years and children for adjuvanted vaccines. Adjuvanted vaccines were significantly more effective in children compared to adults for both outcomes. Conclusions: Adjuvanted and unadjuvanted monovalent influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 vaccines were both effective in preventing LCI. Overall, the vaccines were also effective against influenza-related hospitalization. For both outcomes adjuvanted vaccines were more effective in children than in adults.},

  abstract = {Observational epidemiological studies suffer from many potential biases, from confounding and from reverse causation, and this limits their ability to robustly identify causal associations. Several high-profile situations exist in which randomized controlled trials of precisely the same intervention that has been examined in observational studies have produced markedly different findings. In other observational sciences, the use of instrumental variable (IV) approaches has been one approach to strengthening causal inferences in non-experimental situations. The use of germline genetic variants that proxy for environmentally modifiable exposures as instruments for these exposures is one form of IV analysis that can be implemented within observational epidemiological studies. The method has been referred to as ‘Mendelian randomization’, and can be considered as analogous to randomized controlled trials. This paper outlines Mendelian randomization, draws parallels with IV methods, provides examples of implementation of the approach and discusses limitations of the approach and some methods for dealing with these.

The recent dramatic expansion of study sizes improves power of estimation of effect sizes, genomic prediction, causal inference, and polygenic selection, but it simultaneously increases susceptibility of these methods to bias due to subtle population structure. Standard methods using genetic principal components to correct for structure might not always be appropriate and we use a simulation study to illustrate when correction might be ineffective for avoiding biases. New methods such as trans-ethnic modeling and chromosome painting allow for a richer understanding of the relationship between traits and population structure. We illustrate the arguments using real examples (stroke and educational attainment) and provide a more nuanced understanding of population structure, which is set to be revisited as a critical aspect of future analyses in genetic epidemiology. We also make simple recommendations for how problems can be avoided in the future. Our results have particular importance for the implementation of GWAS meta-analysis, for prediction of traits, and for causal inference.},

Compounds that have been tested included the full monoclonal IgG1 antibodies infliximab and adalimumab, the pegylated anti-TNF F[ab’]2 fragment certolizumab, an IgG4 antiTNF CDP571 with reduced affinity for the Fc receptor, the soluble TNF receptor I onercept, and the TNF receptor II-Fc fusion protein etanercept. The endpoints of these studies suggest that not all methods of blockingTNF are equal. Here we will review the differences in the clinical, biochemical, and endoscopic endpoints of the major clinical studies. Collectively the data suggest that only IgG1 monoclonal antibodies have the ability to induce complete clinical, biochemical, and endoscopic remission. We discuss the potential multiple modes of action that may contribute to the response to full IgG1 anti-TNFs, focusing on the rapid induction of lamina propria T cell apoptosis and Fc receptor-dependent induction of M2-type wound-healing macrophages. We discuss how novel insights into the mechanism of action of anti-TNFs in Crohn’s disease may contribute to the development of novel anti-TNFs with improved efficacy.},

  abstract = {1. Ecological count data typically exhibit complexities such as overdispersion and zero-inflation, and are often weakly associated with a relatively large number of correlated covariates. The use of an appropriate statistical model for inference is therefore essential. A common selection criteria for choosing between nested models is the likelihood ratio test (LRT). Widely used alternatives to the LRT are based on information-theoretic metrics such as the Akaike Information Criterion. 2. It is widely believed that the LRT can only be used to compare the performance of nested models – i.e. in situations where one model is a special case of another. There are many situations in which it is important to compare non-nested models, so, if true, this would be a substantial drawback of using LRTs for model comparison. In reality, however, it is actually possible to use the LRT for comparing both nested and non-nested models. This fact is well-established in the statistical literature, but not widely used in ecological studies. 3. The main obstacle to the use of the LRT with non-nested models has, until relatively recently, been the fact that it is difficult to explicitly write down a formula for the distribution of the LRT statistic under the null hypothesis that one of the models is true. With modern computing power it is possible to overcome this difficulty by using a simulation-based approach. 4. To demonstrate the practical application of the LRT to both nested and non-nested model comparisons, a case study involving data on questing tick (Ixodes ricinus) abundance is presented. These data contain complexities typical in ecological analyses, such as zero-inflation and overdispersion, for which comparison between models of differing structure – e.g. non-nested models – is of particular importance. 5. Choosingbetweencompeting statisticalmodels isanessentialpartof any appliedecological analysis. TheLRTis a standard statistical test for comparing nestedmodels. By use of simulation theLRT can also be used in an analogous fashion to compare non-nested models, thereby providing a unified approachformodel comparisonwithinthenullhypothesis testingparadigm.Asimple practicalguide is provided inhowto apply thisapproach to the keymodels required in the analyses of countdata.},

To achieve this, we did a large-scale network integration of publicly available human blood transcriptomes and systems-scale databases in specific biological contexts and deduced a set of transcription modules in blood. Those modules revealed distinct transcriptional signatures of antibody responses to different classes of vaccines, which provided key insights into primary viral, protein recall and anti-polysaccharide responses. Our results elucidate the early transcriptional programs that orchestrate vaccine immunity in humans and demonstrate the power of integrative network modeling.},

In addition to 17 novel genome-wide significant cytokine QTLs (cQTLs), our study provides a comprehensive picture of the genetic variants that influence six different cytokines in whole blood, blood mononuclear cells, and macrophages. Important biological pathways that contain cytokine QTLs map to pattern recognition receptors (TLR1-6-10 cluster), cytokine and complement inhibitors, and the kallikrein system. The cytokine QTLs show enrichment for monocytespecific enhancers, are more often located in regions under positive selection, and are significantly enriched among SNPs associated with infections and immune-mediated diseases.},

Vaccination induces robust antigen-specific antibody, plasmablasts, and CD4+ T cells yet limited CD8+ T cell and antiviral responses. The MMRN reveals striking associations between orthogonal datasets, such as transcriptomic and metabolomics signatures, cell populations, and cytokine levels, and identifies immune and metabolic correlates of vaccine immunity. Networks associated with inositol phosphate, glycerophospholipids, and sterol metabolism are tightly coupled with immunity. Critically, the sterol regulatory binding protein 1 and its targets are key integrators of antibody and T follicular cell responses. Our approach is broadly applicable to study human immunity and can help to identify predictors of efficacy as well as mechanisms controlling immunity to vaccination.},

  abstract = {Background: Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis identifies genetic markers associated with the expression of a gene. Most existing eQTL analyses and methods investigate association in a single, readily available tissue, such as blood. Joint analysis of eQTL in multiple tissues has the potential to improve, and expand the scope of, single-tissue analyses. Large-scale collaborative efforts such as the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) program are currently generating high quality data in a large number of tissues. However, computational constraints limit genome-wide multi-tissue eQTL analysis. Results: We develop an integrative method under a hierarchical Bayesian framework for eQTL analysis in a large number of tissues. The model fitting procedure is highly scalable, and the computing time is a polynomial function of the number of tissues. Multi-tissue eQTLs are identified through a local false discovery rate approach, which rigorously controls the false discovery rate. Using simulation and GTEx real data studies, we show that the proposed method has superior performance to existing methods in terms of computing time and the power of eQTL discovery. Conclusions: We provide a scalable method for eQTL analysis in a large number of tissues. The method enables the identification of eQTL with different configurations and facilitates the characterization of tissue specificity.},

Methods\hspace{0.6em} We performed a phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) to identify disease outcomes associated with SUA genetic risk loci. We then implemented conventional Mendelianrandomisation (MR) analysis to investigate the causal relevance between SUA level and disease outcomes identified from PheWAS. We next applied MR Egger analysis to detect and account for potential pleiotropy, which conventional MR analysis might mistake for causality, and used the HEIDI (heterogeneity in dependent instruments) test to remove cross-phenotype associations that were likely due to genetic linkage. Results\hspace{0.6em}Our PheWAS identified 25 disease groups/ outcomes associated with SUA genetic risk loci after multiple testing correction (P{$<$}8.57e-05). Our conventional MR analysis implicated a causal role of SUA level in three disease groups: inflammatory polyarthropathies (OR=1.22, 95\% CI 1.11 to 1.34), hypertensive disease (OR=1.08, 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.14) and disorders of metabolism (OR=1.07, 95\% CI 1.01 to 1.14); and four disease outcomes: gout (OR=4.88, 95\% CI 3.91 to 6.09), essential hypertension (OR=1.08, 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.14), myocardial infarction (OR=1.16, 95\% CI 1.03 to 1.30) and coeliac disease (OR=1.41, 95\% CI 1.05 to 1.89). After balancing pleiotropic effects in MR Egger analysis, only gout and its encompassing disease group of inflammatory polyarthropathies were considered to be causally associated with SUA level. Our analysis highlighted a locus (ATXN2/S2HB3) that may influence SUA level and multiple cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases via pleiotropy. Conclusions\hspace{0.6em} Elevated SUA level is convincing to cause gout and inflammatory polyarthropathies, and might act as a marker for the wider range of diseases with which it associates. Our findings support further investigation on the clinical relevance of SUA level with cardiovascular, metabolic, autoimmune and respiratory diseases.},

However, the mechanisms mediating the effects of genetic variants on gene regulation are poorly understood. To determine the functional impact of common genetic variation on the non-coding genome longitudinally during human cortical development, we performed a chromatin accessibility quantitative trait loci (caQTL) analysis in neural progenitor cells and their differentiated neuronal progeny from 92 donors. We identified 8,111 caQTLs in progenitors and 3,676 caQTLs in neurons, with highly temporal, cell-type specific effects. A subset (\textasciitilde 20\%) of caQTLs were also associated with changes in gene expression. Motif-disrupting alleles of transcriptional activators generally led to decreases in chromatin accessibility, whereas motif-disrupting alleles of repressors led to increases in chromatin accessibility. By integrating cell-type specific caQTLs and brain-relevant genome-wide association data, we were able to fine-map loci and identify regulatory mechanisms underlying non-coding neuropsychiatric disorder risk variants.},

  abstract = {Background: In modern biomedical research of complex diseases, a large number of demographic and clinical variables, herein called phenomic data, are often collected and missing values (MVs) are inevitable in the data collection process. Since many downstream statistical and bioinformatics methods require complete data matrix, imputation is a common and practical solution. In high-throughput experiments such as microarray experiments, continuous intensities are measured and many mature missing value imputation methods have been developed and widely applied. Numerous methods for missing data imputation of microarray data have been developed. Large phenomic data, however, contain continuous, nominal, binary and ordinal data types, which void application of most methods. Though several methods have been developed in the past few years, not a single complete guideline is proposed with respect to phenomic missing data imputation. Results: In this paper, we investigated existing imputation methods for phenomic data, proposed a self-training selection (STS) scheme to select the best imputation method and provide a practical guideline for general applications. We introduced a novel concept of “imputability measure” (IM) to identify missing values that are fundamentally inadequate to impute. In addition, we also developed four variations of K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) methods and compared with two existing methods, multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) and missForest. The four variations are imputation by variables (KNN-V), by subjects (KNN-S), their weighted hybrid (KNN-H) and an adaptively weighted hybrid (KNN-A). We performed simulations and applied different imputation methods and the STS scheme to three lung disease phenomic datasets to evaluate the methods. An R package “phenomeImpute” is made publicly available. Conclusions: Simulations and applications to real datasets showed that MICE often did not perform well; KNN-A, KNN-H and random forest were among the top performers although no method universally performed the best. Imputation of missing values with low imputability measures increased imputation errors greatly and could potentially deteriorate downstream analyses. The STS scheme was accurate in selecting the optimal method by evaluating methods in a second layer of missingness simulation. All source files for the simulation and the real data analyses are available on the author’s publication website.},

  abstract = {Antitumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNF) agents have dramatically influenced management of refractory inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, not all patients respond to treatment and some lose response or become intolerant over time. Immunogenicity, a well established phenomenon with anti-TNF agents, may have important clinical implications in patients with IBD. A comprehensive review of available evidence demonstrating how drug concentrations, immunogenicity, and other factors influence outcomes with anti-TNF agents was performed. PubMed, EMBASE, Biosis, Dialog, and Conference Papers Index were searched from 1 January 1995 to 7 April 2012 to identify clinical trials in adult and pediatric patients with IBD treated with anti-TNF agents for Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis. Data on serum drug levels and immunogenicity and their relationship with clinical efficacy and safety outcomes were extracted and examined. Serum infliximab concentrations correlated with clinical efficacy and treatment outcomes in patients with IBD; this relationship is less well characterized with adalimumab and certolizumab pegol concentrations. In multiple studies, the presence and level of antibodies to infliximab correlated with loss of clinical efficacy and increased risk of infusion reactions. The incidence and clinical impact of antibody formation with adalimumab or certolizumab in IBD is becoming evident as more data become available. Current, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based anti-TNF antibody assays are suboptimal in that results are often inconclusive and comparisons between agents cannot be made. Measurement of anti-TNF agent drug concentrations and assessment of immunogenicity has the potential to positively impact clinical decision making during anti-TNF therapy for IBD. As assays are optimized, it is expected that the clinical impact of these determinations will be better characterized.},

However, current methods implement only a very specific range of tasks to optimize the necessary computations. Here, we present a multi-trait modeling framework that is versatile and fast: LIMIX enables to flexibly adapt mixed models for a broad range of applications with different observed and hidden covariates, and variable study designs. To highlight the novel modeling aspects of LIMIX we performed three vastly different genetic studies: joint GWAS of correlated blood lipid phenotypes, joint analysis of the expression levels of the multiple transcript-isoforms of a gene, and pathway-based modeling of molecular traits across environments. In these applications we show that LIMIX increases GWAS power and phenotype prediction accuracy, in particular when integrating stepwise multi-locus regression into multi-trait models, and when analyzing large numbers of traits.

  abstract = {Early genome-wide association studies (GWASs) led to the surprising discovery that, for typical complex traits, most of the heritability is due to huge numbers of common variants with tiny effect sizes. Previously, we argued that new models are needed to understand these patterns. Here, we provide a formal model in which genetic contributions to complex traits are partitioned into direct effects from core genes and indirect effects from peripheral genes acting in trans. We propose that most heritability is driven by weak trans-eQTL SNPs, whose effects are mediated through peripheral genes to impact the expression of core genes. In particular, if the core genes for a trait tend to be co-regulated, then the effects of peripheral variation can be amplified such that nearly all of the genetic variance is driven by weak trans effects. Thus, our model proposes a framework for understanding key features of the architecture of complex traits.},

Phasing is generally performed via statistical phasing within a genotyped cohort, an approach that can attain high accuracy in very large cohorts but attains lower accuracy in smaller cohorts. Here, we instead explore the paradigm of reference-based phasing. We introduce a new phasing algorithm that attains high accuracy across a broad range of cohort sizes by efficiently leveraging information from large external reference panels (such as the Haplotype Reference Consortium, HRC) using a new data structure based on the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform. Our method improves phasing accuracy by {$>$}2x compared to the best publicly available alternative for phasing small European-ancestry cohorts, and it attains a ≈20x speedup and ≈10\% increase in accuracy compared to reference-based phasing using SHAPEIT2. Our method is freely available for reference-based phasing using the HRC panel via the Sanger Imputation Service and the Michigan Imputation Server.},

  abstract = {Background: Variable responses to the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) vaccine have recently been reported as strongly dependent on genetic causes. Yet, the details on such mechanisms of action are still unknown. In parallel, altered DNA methylation states have been uncovered as important contributors to a variety of health conditions. However, methodologies for the analysis of such high-throughput data (epigenomic), especially from the computational point of view, still lack of a gold standard, mostly due to the intrinsic statistical distribution of methylomic data i.e. binomial rather than (pseudo-) normal, which characterizes the better known transcriptomic data. We present in this article our contribution to the challenge of epigenomic data analysis with application to the variable response to the Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccine and its most lethal degeneration: hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods: Twenty-five infants were recruited and classified as good and non-/low- responders according to serological test results. Whole genome DNA methylation states were profiled by Illumina HumanMethylation 450 K beadchips. Data were processed through quality and dispersion filtering and with differential methylation analysis based on a combination of average methylation differences and non-parametric statistical tests. Results were finally associated to already published transcriptomics and post-transcriptomics to gain further insight. Results: We highlight 2 relevant variations in poor-responders to HBV vaccination: the hypomethylation of RNF39 (Ring Finger Protein 39) and the complex biochemical alteration on SULF2 via hypermethylation, down-regulation and post-transcriptional control. Conclusions: Our approach appears to cope with the new challenges implied by methylomic data distribution to warrant a robust ranking of candidates. In particular, being RNF39 within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class I region, its altered methylation state fits with an altered immune reaction compatible with poor responsiveness to vaccination. Additionally, despite SULF2 having been indicated as a potential target for HCC therapy, we can recommend that non-responders to HBV vaccine who develop HCC are quickly directed to other therapies, as SULF2 appears to be already under multiple molecular controls in such patients. Future research in this direction is warranted.},

We then imputed from these sequences into new and existing genome-wide association study cohorts and tested for association at ∼12 million variants in a total of 16,432 cases and 18,843 controls. We discovered a 0.6\% frequency missense variant in ADCY7 that doubles the risk of ulcerative colitis. Despite good statistical power, we did not identify any other new low-frequency risk variants and found that such variants explained little heritability. We detected a burden of very rare, damaging missense variants in known Crohn's disease risk genes, suggesting that more comprehensive sequencing studies will continue to improve understanding of the biology of complex diseases.},

Using a mouse model, we report that antibiotic-driven intestinal dysbiosis, specifically in early life, leads to significantly impaired antibody responses to five different adjuvanted and live vaccines. Restoration of the commensal microbiota following antibiotic exposure rescues these impaired responses. In contrast, antibiotic-treated adult mice do not exhibit impaired antibody responses to vaccination. Interestingly, in contrast to impaired antibody responses, immunized mice exposed to early-life antibiotics display significantly enhanced T cell cytokine recall responses upon ex vivo restimulation with the vaccine antigen. Our results demonstrate that, in mice, antibioticdriven dysregulation of the gut microbiota in early life can modulate immune responses to vaccines that are routinely administered to infants worldwide.},

As more and more datasets are generated and accumulated in the public domain, meta-analysis to combine multiple transcriptomic studies to increase statistical power has received increasing popularity. In this article, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model to jointly integrate microarray and RNA-seq studies. Since systematic fold change differences across RNA-seq and microarray for detecting differentially expressed genes have been previously reported, we replicated this finding in several real datasets and showed that incorporation of a normalization procedure to account for the bias improves the detection accuracy and power. We compared our method with the popular two-stage Fisher’s method using simulations and two real applications in a histological subtype (invasive lobular carcinoma) of breast cancer comparing PR+ versus PR- and early-stage versus late-stage patients. The result showed improved detection power and more significant and interpretable pathways enriched in the detected biomarkers from the proposed Bayesian model.},

The accurate measurement of variations in the human immune system requires precise and standardized assays to distinguish true biological changes from technical artefacts. Thus, to be successful, the Human Immunology Project will require standardized assays for immunophenotyping humans in health and disease.

GCs act primarily through the GC receptor (GR, a transcription factor). Despite their clear biomedical importance, little is known about the genetic architecture of variation in GC response. Here we provide an initial assessment of variability in the cellular response to GC treatment by profiling gene expression and protein secretion in 114 EBV-transformed B lymphocytes of African and European ancestry. We found that genetic variation affects the response of nearby genes and exhibits distinctive patterns of genotype-treatment interactions, with genotypic effects evident in either only GC-treated or only control-treated conditions. Using a novel statistical framework, we identified interactions that influence the expression of 26 genes known to play central roles in GC-related pathways (e.g. NQO1, AIRE, and SGK1) and that influence the secretion of IL6.},

  abstract = {Age affects the immune response to vaccination, with individuals at the extremes of age responding poorly. The initial inflammatory response to antigenic materials shapes the subsequent adaptive response and so understanding is required about the effect of age on the profile of acute inflammatory mediators. In this study we measured the local and systemic inflammatory response after influenza vaccination or infection in neonatal, young adult and aged mice. Mice were immunized intramuscularly with inactivated influenza vaccine with and without the adjuvant MF59 and then challenged with H1N1 influenza. Age was the major factor affecting the inflammatory profile after vaccination: neonatal mice had more interleukin1a (IL-1a), C-reactive protein (CRP) and granulocyte–macrophage colonystimulating factor (GMCSF), young adults more tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF), and elderly mice more interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), IL-2RA and interferon-c-induced protein 10 (IP10). Notably the addition of MF59 induced IL-5, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), Keratinocyte Chemotractant (KC) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) in all ages of animals and levels of these cytokines correlated with antibody responses. Age also had an impact on the efficacy of vaccination: neonatal and young adult mice were protected against challenge, but aged mice were not. There were striking differences in the localization of the cytokine response depending on the route of exposure: vaccination led to a high serum response whereas intranasal infection led to a low serum response but a high lung response. In conclusion, we demonstrate that age affects the inflammatory response to both influenza vaccination and infection. These age-induced differences need to be considered when developing vaccination strategies for different age groups.},

  abstract = {Studies on small sample properties of multilevel models have become increasingly prominent in the methodological literature in response to the frequency with which small sample data appear in empirical studies. Simulation results generally recommend that empirical researchers employ restricted maximum likelihood estimation (REML) with a Kenward-Roger correction with small samples in frequentist contexts to minimize small sample bias in estimation and to prevent inflation of Type-I error rates. However , simulation studies focus on recommendations for best practice, and there is little to no explanation of why traditional maximum likelihood (ML) breaks down with smaller samples, what differentiates REML from ML, or how the Kenward-Roger correction remedies lingering small sample issues. Due to the complexity of these methods, most extant descriptions are highly mathematical and are intended to prove that the methods improve small sample performance as intended. Thus, empirical researchers have documentation that these methods are advantageous but still lack resources to help understand what the methods actually do and why they are needed. This tutorial explains why ML falters with small samples, how REML circumvents some issues, and how Kenward-Roger works. We do so without equations or derivations to support more widespread understanding and use of these valuable methods.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional regulation and posttranscriptional processing underlie many cellular and organismal phenotypes. We used RNA sequence data generated by Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project to investigate the patterns of transcriptome variation across individuals and tissues. Tissues exhibit characteristic transcriptional signatures that show stability in postmortem samples. These signatures are dominated by a relatively small number of genes—which is most clearly seen in blood—though few are exclusive to a particular tissue and vary more across tissues than individuals. Genes exhibiting high interindividual expression variation include disease candidates associated with sex, ethnicity, and age. Primary transcription is the major driver of cellular specificity, with splicing playing mostly a complementary role; except for the brain, which exhibits a more divergent splicing program. Variation in splicing, despite its stochasticity, may play in contrast a comparatively greater role in defining individual phenotypes. Expression, genetic variation, and tissues Human genomes show extensive genetic variation across individuals, but we have only just started documenting the effects of this variation on the regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, only a few tissues have been examined per genetic variant. In order to examine how genetic expression varies among tissues within individuals, the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium collected 1641 postmortem samples covering 54 body sites from 175 individuals. They identified quantitative genetic traits that affect gene expression and determined which of these exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns. Melé et al. measured how transcription varies among tissues, and Rivas et al. looked at how truncated protein variants affect expression across tissues.

Thinking about the title early—and regularly returning to hone it—can help not only the writing of the paper but also the process of designing experiments or developing theories. This Rule of One is the most difficult rule to optimally implement because it comes face-toface with the key challenge of science, which is to make the claim and/or model as simple as the data and logic can support but no simpler. In the end, your struggle to find this balance may appropriately result in “one contribution” that is multifaceted. For example, a technology paper may describe both its new technology and a biological result using it; the bridge that unifies these two facets is a clear description of how the new technology can be used to do new biology.},

  abstract = {Analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) provides a means for detecting transcriptional regulatory relationships at a genome-wide scale. Here we explain the eQTL analysis pipeline, we introduce publicly available tools for the statistical analysis, and we discuss issues that might complicate the eQTL mapping process. The detection and interpretation of eQTL requires careful consideration of a range of potentially confounding effects. Particularly population substructure and batch effects may lead to the detection of many false-positive eQTL if not accounted for. Traditionally, most eQTL mapping methods only check for the correlation of single loci with gene expression. In order to detect (epistatic) interactions between distant genetic loci one has to take into account several loci simultaneously. Here, we present the Random Forest regression method as a way of accounting for interacting loci. Next, we introduce analysis methods aiding the biological interpretation of detected eQTL. For example, the notion of local (cis) and distant (trans) eQTL has been very useful for interpreting the causes and implications of eQTL in many studies. In addition, Bayesian networks have been used extensively to infer causal relationships among eQTL and between eQTL and other genetic associations (e.g. disease associated loci). Also, the integration of eQTL with complementary information such as physical protein interaction data may significantly improve statistical power and provide insight into possible molecular mechanisms linking the regulator to its target gene. The eQTL approach is potentially very powerful for the analysis of regulatory pathways affecting disease susceptibility and other relevant traits. However, careful analysis is required to unleash its full potential.},

  abstract = {Background: The analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) is a potentially powerful way to detect transcriptional regulatory relationships at the genomic scale. However, eQTL data sets often go underexploited because legacy QTL methods are used to map the relationship between the expression trait and genotype. Often these methods are inappropriate for complex traits such as gene expression, particularly in the case of epistasis. Results: Here we compare legacy QTL mapping methods with several modern multi-locus methods and evaluate their ability to produce eQTL that agree with independent external data in a systematic way. We found that the modern multi-locus methods (Random Forests, sparse partial least squares, lasso, and elastic net) clearly outperformed the legacy QTL methods (Haley-Knott regression and composite interval mapping) in terms of biological relevance of the mapped eQTL. In particular, we found that our new approach, based on Random Forests, showed superior performance among the multi-locus methods. Conclusions: Benchmarks based on the recapitulation of experimental findings provide valuable insight when selecting the appropriate eQTL mapping method. Our battery of tests suggests that Random Forests map eQTL that are more likely to be validated by independent data, when compared to competing multi-locus and legacy eQTL mapping methods.},

  abstract = {Background: Genomic and other high dimensional analyses often require one to summarize multiple related variables by a single representative. This task is also variously referred to as collapsing, combining, reducing, or aggregating variables. Examples include summarizing several probe measurements corresponding to a single gene, representing the expression profiles of a co-expression module by a single expression profile, and aggregating celltype marker information to de-convolute expression data. Several standard statistical summary techniques can be used, but network methods also provide useful alternative methods to find representatives. Currently few collapsing functions are developed and widely applied. Results: We introduce the R function collapseRows that implements several collapsing methods and evaluate its performance in three applications. First, we study a crucial step of the meta-analysis of microarray data: the merging of independent gene expression data sets, which may have been measured on different platforms. Toward this end, we collapse multiple microarray probes for a single gene and then merge the data by gene identifier. We find that choosing the probe with the highest average expression leads to best between-study consistency. Second, we study methods for summarizing the gene expression profiles of a co-expression module. Several gene co-expression network analysis applications show that the optimal collapsing strategy depends on the analysis goal. Third, we study aggregating the information of cell type marker genes when the aim is to predict the abundance of cell types in a tissue sample based on gene expression data ("expression deconvolution”). We apply different collapsing methods to predict cell type abundances in peripheral human blood and in mixtures of blood cell lines. Interestingly, the most accurate prediction method involves choosing the most highly connected “hub” marker gene. Finally, to facilitate biological interpretation of collapsed gene lists, we introduce the function userListEnrichment, which assesses the enrichment of gene lists for known brain and blood cell type markers, and for other published biological pathways. Conclusions: The R function collapseRows implements several standard and network-based collapsing methods. In various genomic applications we provide evidence that both types of methods are robust and biologically relevant tools.},

  abstract = {Background: There has been intense effort over the past couple of decades to identify loci underlying quantitative traits as a key step in the process of elucidating the etiology of complex diseases. Recently there has been some effort to coalesce non-biased high-throughput data, e.g. high density genotyping and genome wide RNA expression, to drive understanding of the molecular basis of disease. However, a stumbling block has been the difficult question of how to leverage this information to identify molecular mechanisms that explain quantitative trait loci (QTL). We have developed a formal statistical hypothesis test, resulting in a p-value, to quantify uncertainty in a causal inference pertaining to a measured factor, e.g. a molecular species, which potentially mediates a known causal association between a locus and a quantitative trait. Results: We treat the causal inference as a 'chain' of mathematical conditions that must be satisfied to conclude that the potential mediator is causal for the trait, where the inference is only as good as the weakest link in the chain. P-values are computed for the component conditions, which include tests of linkage and conditional independence. The Intersection-Union Test, in which a series of statistical tests are combined to form an omnibus test, is then employed to generate the overall test result. Using computer simulated mouse crosses, we show that type I error is low under a variety of conditions that include hidden variables and reactive pathways. We show that power under a simple causal model is comparable to other model selection techniques as well as Bayesian network reconstruction methods. We further show empirically that this method compares favorably to Bayesian network reconstruction methods for reconstructing transcriptional regulatory networks in yeast, recovering 7 out of 8 experimentally validated regulators. Conclusion: Here we propose a novel statistical framework in which existing notions of causal mediation are formalized into a hypothesis test, thus providing a standard quantitative measure of uncertainty in the form of a p-value. The method is theoretically and computationally accessible and with the provided software may prove a useful tool in disentangling molecular relationships.},

  abstract = {Background: Readily accessible samples such as peripheral blood or cell lines are increasingly being used in large cohorts to characterise gene expression differences between a patient group and healthy controls. However, cell and RNA isolation procedures and the variety of cell types that make up whole blood can affect gene expression measurements. We therefore systematically investigated global gene expression profiles in peripheral blood from six individuals collected during two visits by comparing five of the following cell and RNA isolation methods: whole blood (PAXgene), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), CD19 and CD20 specific B-cell subsets. Results: Gene expression measurements were clearly discriminated by isolation method although the reproducibility was high for all methods (range r = 0.90-1.00). The PAXgene samples showed a decrease in the number of expressed genes (P {$<$} 1*10-16) with higher variability (P {$<$} 1*10-16) compared to the other methods. Differentially expressed probes between PAXgene and PBMCs were correlated with the number of monocytes, lymphocytes, neutrophils or erythrocytes. The correlations (r = 0.83; r = 0.79) of the expression levels of detected probes between LCLs and B-cell subsets were much lower compared to the two B-cell isolation methods (r = 0.98). Gene ontology analysis of detected genes showed that genes involved in inflammatory responses are enriched in B-cells CD19 and CD20 whereas genes involved in alcohol metabolic process and the cell cycle were enriched in LCLs. Conclusion: Gene expression profiles in blood-based samples are strongly dependent on the predominant constituent cell type(s) and RNA isolation method. It is crucial to understand the differences and variability of gene expression measurements between cell and RNA isolation procedures, and their relevance to disease processes, before application in large clinical studies.},

This claim is at odds with publicly available data from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC; http://exac.broadinstitute. org). The allele frequency of R415Q is not significantly higher in cases (0.024\%–0.049\%) than in ExAC population controls (0.031\%), whereas if R415Q conferred even 50\% lifetime risk of developing MS, it would be hundreds of times more common in cases than in controls. The upper bound of the 95\% confidence interval of penetrance for R415Q can be estimated at 2.2\% for women and 1.2\% for men, indicating that even if this variant is disease associated, individuals harboring the variant would have a lifetime risk of developing MS no higher than a few percent. ExAC data should be considered when evaluating claims of variant pathogenicity. This Matters Arising paper is in response to Wang et al. (2016a), published in Neuron.

  abstract = {Interpreting the susceptible loci documented by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is of utmost importance in the post-GWAS era. Since most complex traits are contributed by multiple tissues, analyzing tissue-specific effects of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) is a promising approach. Here we describe “opposite eQTL effects”, i.e., gene expression effects of eQTLs that are in the opposite direction between different tissues, as the biologically meaningful annotations of genes and genetic variants for understanding the GWAS loci. The genes and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the opposite eQTL effects (opp-multi-eQTL-Genes and opp-multi-eQTL-SNPs) were extracted from the largest eQTL database provided by the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project (release version 7). The opposite eQTL effects were detected even between closely related tissues such as cerebellum and brain cortex, and a significant proportion of the genes having eQTLs were annotated as the opp-multi-eQTL-Genes (2,323 out of 31,212; 7.4\%). The opp-multi-eQTLSNPs showed locational enrichment at the transcription start site and also possible involvement of epigenetic regulation. The biological importance of the opposite eQTL effects was also assessed using the SNPs reported in GWASs (GWAS-SNPs), which demonstrated that a high proportion of the opp-multi-eQTL-SNPs are in linkage disequilibrium with the GWAS-SNPs (2,498 out of 9,290; 26.9\%). Based on the results, the opposite eQTL effects can be a common phenomenon in the tissuespecific gene regulation with a possible contribution to the development of complex traits.},

  abstract = {Overwhelming evidence shows the quality of reporting of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) is not optimal. Without transparent reporting, readers cannot judge the reliability and validity of trial findings nor extract information for systematic reviews. Recent methodological analyses indicate that inadequate reporting and design are associated with biased estimates of treatment effects. Such systematic error is seriously damaging to RCTs, which are considered the gold standard for evaluating interventions because of their ability to minimise or avoid bias. A group of scientists and editors developed the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to improve the quality of reporting of RCTs. It was first published in 1996 and updated in 2001. The statement consists of a checklist and flow diagram that authors can use for reporting an RCT. Many leading medical journals and major international editorial groups have endorsed the CONSORT statement. The statement facilitates critical appraisal and interpretation of RCTs. During the 2001 CONSORT revision, it became clear that explanation and elaboration of the principles underlying the CONSORT statement would help investigators and others to write or appraise trial reports. A CONSORT explanation and elaboration article was published in 2001 alongside the 2001 version of the CONSORT statement. After an expert meeting in January 2007, the CONSORT statement has been further revised and is published as the CONSORT 2010 Statement. This update improves the wording and clarity of the previous checklist and incorporates recommendations related to topics that have only recently received recognition, such as selective outcome reporting bias. This explanatory and elaboration document—intended to enhance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the CONSORT statement—has also been extensively revised. It presents the meaning and rationale for each new and updated checklist item providing examples of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies. Several examples of flow diagrams are included. The CONSORT 2010 Statement, this revised explanatory and elaboration document, and the associated website (www. consort-statement.org) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of randomised trials.},

To identify the mechanisms underlying the variability of the immune response to vaccines, system-level tools need to be developed that will further our understanding of virus-host interactions and correlates of vaccine efficacy. This will provide critical information for rational vaccine design and allow the development of an analog to the "precision medicine" framework (already acknowledged as a powerful approach in medicine and therapeutics) to be applied to vaccinology. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Interval estimates – estimates of parameters that include an allowance for sampling uncertainty – have long been touted as a key component of statistical analyses. There are several kinds of interval estimates, but the most popular are confidence intervals (CIs): intervals that contain the true parameter value in some known proportion of repeated samples, on average. The width of confidence intervals is thought to index the precision of an estimate; CIs are thought to be a guide to which parameter values are plausible or reasonable; and the confidence coefficient of the interval (e.g., 95 \%) is thought to index the plausibility that the true parameter is included in the interval. We show in a number of examples that CIs do not necessarily have any of these properties, and can lead to unjustified or arbitrary inferences. For this reason, we caution against relying upon confidence interval theory to justify interval estimates, and suggest that other theories of interval estimation should be used instead.},

  abstract = {In 2011, AstraZeneca embarked on a major revision of its research and development (R\&D) strategy with the aim of improving R\&D productivity, which was below industry averages in 2005–2010. A cornerstone of the revised strategy was to focus decision-making on five technical determinants (the right target, right tissue, right safety, right patient and right commercial potential). In this article, we describe the progress made using this ‘5R framework’ in the hope that our experience could be useful to other companies tackling R\&D productivity issues. We focus on the evolution of our approach to target validation, hit and lead optimization, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic modelling and drug safety testing, which have helped improve the quality of candidate drug nomination, as well as the development of the right culture, where ‘truth seeking’ is encouraged by more rigorous and quantitative decision-making. We also discuss where the approach has failed and the lessons learned. Overall, the continued evolution and application of the 5R framework are beginning to have an impact, with success rates from candidate drug nomination to phase III completion improving from 4\% in 2005–2010 to 19\% in 2012–2016.},

To determine whether Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) alleles modulate seroprotection to influenza, a cohort of HLA class II-typed high-risk vaccine recipients was investigated. Haemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) titres were measured 14–40 days post-subunit vaccination. Seroprotection was defined as HAI titres reaching 40 or greater for all three vaccine strains. HLA-DRB1*04:01 and HLA-DPB1*04:01 alleles were detected at higher frequencies in seroprotected compared with non-seroprotected individuals.

  abstract = {Abstract           The effects of trait-associated variants are often studied in a single relevant cell-type or context. However, for many complex traits, multiple cell-types are involved. This applies particularly to immune-related traits, for which many immune cell-types and contexts play a role. Here, we studied the impact of immune gene regulatory variants on complex traits to better understand genetic risk mediated through immune cell-types. We identified 26,271 expression quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 23,121 splicing QTLs in 18 immune cell-types, and analyzed their overlap with trait-associated loci from 72 genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We showed that effects on RNA expression and splicing in immune cells colocalize with an average of 40.4\% and 27.7\% GWAS loci for immune-related and non-immune traits, respectively. Notably, we found that a large number of loci (mean: 14\%) colocalize with splicing QTLs but not expression QTLs. The 60\% GWAS loci without colocalization harbor genes that have lower expression levels, are less tolerant to loss-of-function mutations, and more enhancerrich than genes at colocalized loci. To further investigate the 60\% GWAS loci not explained by our regulatory QTLs, we collected H3K27ac CUT\&Tag data from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and healthy controls. We found several unexplained GWAS hits lying within regions with higher H3K27ac activity in RA patients. We also observed that enrichment of RA GWAS heritability is greater in H3K27ac regions in immune cell-types from RA patients compared to healthy controls. Our study paves the way for future QTL studies to elucidate the mechanisms of as yet unexplained GWAS loci.},

  abstract = {Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α is a key mediator of inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, and its discovery led to the development of highly successful anti-TNF therapy. Subsequently, other biologic drugs targeting immune pathways, namely interleukin-6 blockade, B cell depletion, and T cell co-stimulation blockade, have been developed. Not all patients respond to a biologic drug, leading to a knowledge gap between biologic therapies available and the confident prediction of response. So far, genetic studies have failed to uncover clinically informative biomarkers to predict response. Given that the targets of biologics are immune pathways, immunological study has become all the more pertinent. Furthermore, advances in single-cell technology have enabled the characterization of many leucocyte subsets. Studying the blood immunophenotype may therefore, define biomarker profiles relevant to each individual patient’s disease and treatment outcome. This review summarises our current understanding of how immune biomarkers might be able to predict treatment response to biologic drugs.},

  abstract = {Technical variation plays an important role in microarray-based gene expression studies, and batch effects explain a large proportion of this noise. It is therefore mandatory to elimi-nate technical variation while maintaining biological variability. Several strategies have been proposed for the removal of batch effects, although they have not been evaluated in large-scale longitudinal gene expression data. In this study, we aimed at identifying a suit-able method for batch effect removal in a large study of microarray-based longitudinal gene expression. Monocytic gene expression was measured in 1092 participants of the Guten-berg Health Study at baseline and 5-year follow up. Replicates of selected samples were measured at both time points to identify technical variability. Deming regression, Passing-Bablok regression, linear mixed models, non-linear models as well as ReplicateRUV and ComBat were applied to eliminate batch effects between replicates. In a second step, quan-tile normalization prior to batch effect correction was performed for each method. Technical PLOS ONE | Funding: The Gutenberg Health Study is funded through the government of Rhineland-Palatinate (" Stiftung Rheinland-Pfalz für Innovation " , contract AZ 961-386261/733), the research programs " Wissenschafft Zukunft " and " Center for Translational Vascular Biology (CTVB) " of the Johannes variation between batches was evaluated by principal component analysis. Associations between body mass index and transcriptomes were calculated before and after batch removal. Results from association analyses were compared to evaluate maintenance of biological variability. Quantile normalization, separately performed in each batch, combined with ComBat successfully reduced batch effects and maintained biological variability. Repli-cateRUV performed perfectly in the replicate data subset of the study, but failed when applied to all samples. All other methods did not substantially reduce batch effects in the replicate data subset. Quantile normalization plus ComBat appears to be a valuable approach for batch correction in longitudinal gene expression data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Defining the parameters that modulate vaccine responses in African populations will be imperative to design effective vaccines for protection against HIV, malaria, tuberculosis, and dengue virus infections. This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of the patient-specific immune microenvironment to the response to the licensed yellow fever vaccine 17D (YF-17D) in an African cohort. METHODS We compared responses to YF-17D in 50 volunteers in Entebbe, Uganda, and 50 volunteers in Lausanne, Switzerland. We measured the CD8+ T cell and B cell responses induced by YF-17D and correlated them with immune parameters analyzed by flow cytometry prior to vaccination. RESULTS We showed that YF-17D-induced CD8+ T cell and B cell responses were substantially lower in immunized individuals from Entebbe compared with immunized individuals from Lausanne. The impaired vaccine response in the Entebbe cohort associated with reduced YF-17D replication. Prior to vaccination, we observed higher frequencies of exhausted and activated NK cells, differentiated T and B cell subsets and proinflammatory monocytes, suggesting an activated immune microenvironment in the Entebbe volunteers. Interestingly, activation of CD8+ T cells and B cells as well as proinflammatory monocytes at baseline negatively correlated with YF-17D-neutralizing antibody titers after vaccination. Additionally, memory T and B cell responses in preimmunized volunteers exhibited reduced persistence in the Entebbe cohort but were boosted by a second vaccination. CONCLUSION Together, these results demonstrate that an activated immune microenvironment prior to vaccination impedes efficacy of the YF-17D vaccine in an African cohort and suggest that vaccine regimens may need to be boosted in African populations to achieve efficient immunity.

We studied healthy adults vaccinated with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). TIV induced higher antibody titers and more plasmablasts than LAIV did. In subjects vaccinated with TIV, early molecular signatures correlated with and could be used to accurately predict later antibody titers in two independent trials. Notably, expression of the kinase CaMKIV at day 3 was inversely correlated with later antibody titers. Vaccination of CaMKIV-deficient mice with TIV induced enhanced antigen-specific antibody titers, which demonstrated an unappreciated role for CaMKIV in the regulation of antibody responses. Thus, systems approaches can be used to predict immunogenicity and provide new mechanistic insights about vaccines.},

  abstract = {The dynamics and molecular mechanisms underlying vaccine immunity in early childhood remain poorly understood. Here we applied systems approaches to investigate the innate and adaptive responses to trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) and MF59-adjuvanted TIV (ATIV) in 90 14- to 24-mo-old healthy children. MF59 enhanced the magnitude and kinetics of serum antibody titers following vaccination, and induced a greater frequency of vaccine specific, multicytokine-producing CD4(+) T cells. Compared with transcriptional responses to TIV vaccination previously reported in adults, responses to TIV in infants were markedly attenuated, limited to genes regulating antiviral and antigen presentation pathways, and observed only in a subset of vaccinees. In contrast, transcriptional responses to ATIV boost were more homogenous and robust. Interestingly, a day 1 gene signature characteristic of the innate response (antiviral IFN genes, dendritic cell, and monocyte responses) correlated with hemagglutination at day 28. These findings demonstrate that MF59 enhances the magnitude, kinetics, and consistency of the innate and adaptive response to vaccination with the seasonal influenza vaccine during early childhood, and identify potential molecular correlates of antibody responses.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Genome-wide association studies have now identified tens of thousands of noncoding loci associated with human diseases and complex traits, each of which could reveal insights into biological mechanisms of disease. Many of the underlying causal variants are thought to affect enhancers, but we have lacked genome-wide maps of enhancer-gene regulation to interpret such variants. We previously developed the Activity-by-Contact (ABC) Model to predict enhancer-gene connections and demonstrated that it can accurately predict the results of CRISPR perturbations across several cell types. Here, we apply this ABC Model to create enhancer-gene maps in 131 cell types and tissues, and use these maps to interpret the functions of fine-mapped GWAS variants. For inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), causal variants are {$>$}20-fold enriched in enhancers in particular cell types, and ABC outperforms other regulatory methods at connecting noncoding variants to target genes. Across 72 diseases and complex traits, ABC links 5,036 GWAS signals to 2,249 unique genes, including a class of 577 genes that appear to influence multiple phenotypes via variants in enhancers that act in different cell types. Guided by these variant-to-function maps, we show that an enhancer containing an IBD risk variant regulates the expression of             PPIF             to tune mitochondrial membrane potential. Together, our study reveals insights into principles of genome regulation, illuminates mechanisms that influence IBD, and demonstrates a generalizable strategy to connect common disease risk variants to their molecular and cellular functions.},

  abstract = {Background: Immunometabolism plays a central role in many cardiometabolic diseases. However, a robust map of immune-related gene networks in circulating human cells, their interactions with metabolites, and their genetic control is still lacking. Here, we integrate blood transcriptomic, metabolomic, and genomic profiles from two population-based cohorts (total N = 2168), including a subset of individuals with matched multi-omic data at 7-year follow-up. Results: We identify topologically replicable gene networks enriched for diverse immune functions including cytotoxicity, viral response, B cell, platelet, neutrophil, and mast cell/basophil activity. These immune gene modules show complex patterns of association with 158 circulating metabolites, including lipoprotein subclasses, lipids, fatty acids, amino acids, small molecules, and CRP. Genome-wide scans for module expression quantitative trait loci (mQTLs) reveal five modules with mQTLs that have both cis and trans effects. The strongest mQTL is in ARHGEF3 (rs1354034) and affects a module enriched for platelet function, independent of platelet counts. Modules of mast cell/basophil and neutrophil function show temporally stable metabolite associations over 7-year follow-up, providing evidence that these modules and their constituent gene products may play central roles in metabolic inflammation. Furthermore, the strongest mQTL in ARHGEF3 also displays clear temporal stability, supporting widespread trans effects at this locus. Conclusions: This study provides a detailed map of natural variation at the blood immunometabolic interface and its genetic basis, and may facilitate subsequent studies to explain inter-individual variation in cardiometabolic disease.},

Mean antibody level is therefore frequently used as a serological surrogate endpoint for vaccine efficacy. In addition, a dichotomous surrogate endpoint is often defined: seroprotection. We explore the relationship between mean antibody level, seroprotection and clinical protection from influenza, using a simple statistical model. The model reveals that the relationship depends not only on the mean but also on the dispersion of the antibody levels, the threshold for clinical protection and the clinical protection curve. The consequences for the interpretation of mean antibody levels and seroprotection rates in terms of clinical protection from influenza are discussed.},

  abstract = {There is particular interest in transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) - gene-level tests based on multi-SNP predictive models of gene expression - for identifying causal genes at loci associated with complex traits. However, interpretation of TWAS associations may be complicated by divergent effects of model SNPs on trait phenotype and gene expression. We developed an iterative modelling scheme for obtaining multi-SNP models of gene expression and applied this framework to generate expression models for 43 human tissues from the Genotype-Tissues Expression (GTEx) Project. We characterized the performance of single- and multi-SNP TWAS models for identifying causal genes in GWAS data for 46 circulating metabolites. We show that: (a) multi-SNP models captured more variation in expression than the top                          -eQTL (median 2 fold improvement); (b) predicted expression based on multi-SNP models was associated (FDR\&lt;0.01) with metabolite levels for 826 unique gene-metabolite pairs, but, after step-wise conditional analyses, 90\% were dominated by a single eQTL SNP; (c) amongst the 35\% of associations where a SNP in the expression model was a significant                          -eQTL and metabolomic-QTL (met-QTL), 92\% demonstrated colocalization between these signals, but interpretation was often complicated by incomplete overlap of QTLs in multi-SNP models; (d) using a “truth” set of causal genes at 61 met-QTLs, the sensitivity was high (67\%), but the positive predictive value was low, as only 8\% of TWAS associations at met-QTLs involved true causal genes. These results guide the interpretation of TWAS and highlight the need for corroborative data to provide confident assignment of causality.},

  abstract = {Individuals from different populations vary considerably in their susceptibility to immune-related diseases. To understand how genetic variation and natural selection contribute to these differences, we tested for the effects of African versus European ancestry on the transcriptional response of primary macrophages to live bacterial pathogens. A total of 9.3\% of macrophage-expressed genes show ancestry-associated differences in the gene regulatory response to infection, and African ancestry specifically predicts a stronger inflammatory response and reduced intracellular bacterial growth. A large proportion of these differences are under genetic control: for 804 genes, more than 75\% of ancestry effects on the immune response can be explained by a single cis- or trans-acting expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL). Finally, we show that genetic effects on the immune response are strongly enriched for recent, population-specific signatures of adaptation. Together, our results demonstrate how historical selective events continue to shape human phenotypic diversity today, including for traits that are key to controlling infection.},

  abstract = {A number of factors are recognised to influence immune responses to vaccinations including age, gender, the dose and quality of the antigen used, the number of doses given, the route of administration and the nutritional status of the recipient. Additionally, several immunogenetic studies have identified associations between polymorphisms in genes encoding immune response proteins, both innate and adaptive, and variation in responses to vaccines. Variants in the genes encoding Toll-like receptors, HLA molecules, cytokines, cytokine receptors have associated with heterogeneity of responses to a wide range of vaccines including measles, hepatitis B, influenza A, BCG, Haemophilus influenzae type b and certain Neisseria meningitidis serotypes, amongst others. However, the vast majority of these studies have been conducted in older children and adults and there are very few data available from studies conducted in infants. This paper reviews the evidence to date that host genes influencing vaccines responses in these older population and identifies a large gap in our understanding of the genetic regulation of responses in early life. . Given the high mortality from infection in early life and the challenges of developing vaccines that generate effective immune responses in the context of the developing immune system further research on infant populations is required.},

  abstract = {Background: Many high-throughput experiments compare two phenotypes such as disease vs. healthy, with the goal of understanding the underlying biological phenomena characterizing the given phenotype. Because of the importance of this type of analysis, more than 70 pathway analysis methods have been proposed so far. These can be categorized into two main categories: non-topology-based (non-TB) and topology-based (TB). Although some review papers discuss this topic from different aspects, there is no systematic, large-scale assessment of such methods. Furthermore, the majority of the pathway analysis approaches rely on the assumption of uniformity of p values under the null hypothesis, which is often not true. Results: This article presents the most comprehensive comparative study on pathway analysis methods available to date. We compare the actual performance of 13 widely used pathway analysis methods in over 1085 analyses. These comparisons were performed using 2601 samples from 75 human disease data sets and 121 samples from 11 knockout mouse data sets. In addition, we investigate the extent to which each method is biased under the null hypothesis. Together, these data and results constitute a reliable benchmark against which future pathway analysis methods could and should be tested. Conclusion: Overall, the result shows that no method is perfect. In general, TB methods appear to perform better than non-TB methods. This is somewhat expected since the TB methods take into consideration the structure of the pathway which is meant to describe the underlying phenomena. We also discover that most, if not all, listed approaches are biased and can produce skewed results under the null.},

  abstract = {While there have been studies exploring regulatory variation in one or more tissues, the complexity of tissue-specificity in multiple primary tissues is not yet well understood. We explore in depth the role of cis-regulatory variation in three human tissues: lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL), skin, and fat. The samples (156 LCL, 160 skin, 166 fat) were derived simultaneously from a subset of well-phenotyped healthy female twins of the MuTHER resource. We discover an abundance of cis-eQTLs in each tissue similar to previous estimates (858 or 4.7\% of genes). In addition, we apply factor analysis (FA) to remove effects of latent variables, thus more than doubling the number of our discoveries (1,822 eQTL genes). The unique study design (Matched Co-Twin Analysis—MCTA) permits immediate replication of eQTLs using co-twins (93\%–98\%) and validation of the considerable gain in eQTL discovery after FA correction. We highlight the challenges of comparing eQTLs between tissues. After verifying previous significance threshold-based estimates of tissue-specificity, we show their limitations given their dependency on statistical power. We propose that continuous estimates of the proportion of tissue-shared signals and direct comparison of the magnitude of effect on the fold change in expression are essential properties that jointly provide a biologically realistic view of tissue-specificity. Under this framework we demonstrate that 30\% of eQTLs are shared among the three tissues studied, while another 29\% appear exclusively tissue-specific. However, even among the shared eQTLs, a substantial proportion (10\%–20\%) have significant differences in the magnitude of fold change between genotypic classes across tissues. Our results underline the need to account for the complexity of eQTL tissue-specificity in an effort to assess consequences of such variants for complex traits.},

Clinicians using the evidence from epidemiological studies should be aware of the specific qualities and limitations of each study design. The purpose of the article is therefore to provide a brief overview of the range of study designs and to comment on the most important strengths and weaknesses of these designs. In general, RCTs are the optimal study design to study the effects of therapy or other interventions and to establish causality, although their use is limited by ethical and practical concerns. Conversely, observational study designs, including case reports, case series, cross-sectional studies, case-control studies and cohort studies, are usually more useful than RCTs for non-therapeutic research questions. In conclusion, both observational studies and RCTs fulfill a complementary and valuable role in nephrology.},

These two non-live vaccines show different magnitudes of transcriptional responses at different time points after vaccination. Software solutions were developed to explore correlates of vaccine efficacy measured as antibody titers at day 28. These enabled a further dissection of transcriptional responses. Thus, the innate response, measured within hours in the peripheral blood, was dominated by an interferon transcriptional signature after influenza vaccination and by an inflammation signature after pneumococcal vaccination. Day 7 plasmablast responses induced by both vaccines was more pronounced after pneumococcal vaccination. Together, these results suggest that comparing global immune responses elicited by different vaccines will be critical to our understanding of the immune mechanisms underpinning successful vaccination. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

Yet, there is considerable variability in the magnitude and persistence of vaccine-induced immunity. Maintenance of specific antibody is essential for continuity of vaccine-induced serological protection. We conducted a genome-wide association study into the persistence of immunity to three childhood vaccines: capsular group C meningococcal (MenC), Haemophilus influenzae type b, and tetanus toxoid (TT) vaccines. We detail associations between variants in a locus containing a family of signal-regulatory proteins and the persistence MenC immunity. We postulate a regulatory role for the lead SNP, with supporting epigenetic and expression quantitative trait loci data. Furthermore, we define associations between SNPs in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) locus and the persistence of TT-specific immunity. Moreover, we describe four classical HLA alleles, HLA DRB1*0301, HLA DQB1*0201, HLA DQB1*0602, and HLA DRB1*1501, associated with TT-specific immunity, independent of the lead SNP association.},

Here, we performed longitudinal analyses in 100 newborn children, sampled up to 4 times during their first 3 months of life. From 100 mL of blood, we analyze the development of 58 immune cell populations by mass cytometry and 267 plasma proteins by immunoassays, uncovering drastic changes not predictable from cord blood measurements but following a stereotypic pattern.

We also analyzed, whether novel risk variants would explain vaccine-related narcolepsy. We found that previously discovered risk variants had strong predictive power (accuracy of 73\% and P{$<$}2.2*10-16; and ROC curve AUC 0.88) in vaccine-related narcolepsy cases with only 4.9\% of cases being assigned to the low risk category. Our findings indicate genetic predisposition to vaccine-triggered narcolepsy, with the possibility of identifying 95\% of people at risk.},

One direct and powerful way to assess the genetic causality behind GWAS is through expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Here we describe a novel approach to estimate the tissues giving rise to the genetic causality behind a wide variety of GWAS traits, using the cis-eQTLs identified in 44 tissues of the GTEx consortium. We have adapted the Regulatory Trait Concordance (RTC) score, to on the one hand measure the tissue sharing probabilities of eQTLs, and also to calculate the probability that a GWAS and an eQTL variant tag the same underlying functional effect. We show that our tissue sharing estimates significantly correlate with commonly used estimates of tissue sharing. By normalizing the GWAS-eQTL probabilities with the tissue sharing estimates of the eQTLs, we can estimate the tissues from which GWAS genetic causality arises. Our approach not only indicates the gene mediating individual GWAS signals, but also can highlight tissues where the genetic causality for an individual trait is manifested.},

I also review the empirical study of fitness, emphasizing approaches that take advantage of recent genetic and genomic data, and I highlight important unresolved problems in understanding fitness.},

  abstract = {The complex network of specialized cells and molecules in the immune system has evolved to defend against pathogens, but inadvertent immune system attacks on ‘‘self’’ result in autoimmune disease. Both genetic regulation of immune cell levels and their relationships with autoimmunity are largely undetermined. Here, we report genetic contributions to quantitative levels of 95 cell types encompassing 272 immune traits, in a cohort of 1,629 individuals from four clustered Sardinian villages. We first estimated trait heritability, showing that it can be substantial, accounting for up to 87\% of the variance (mean 41\%). Next, by assessing \$8.2 million variants that we identified and confirmed in an extended set of 2,870 individuals, 23 independent variants at 13 loci associated with at least one trait. Notably, variants at three loci (HLA, IL2RA, and SH2B3/ATXN2) overlap with known autoimmune disease associations. These results connect specific cellular phenotypes to specific genetic variants, helping to explicate their involvement in disease.},

As RNA-seq becomes more affordable, whole genome transcriptional profiling is likely to become the platform of choice for species with good genomic sequences. As yet, a rigorous analysis methodology has not been developed and we are still in the stages of exploring the features of the data. Results: We investigated the effect of transcript length bias in RNA-seq data using three different published data sets. For standard analyses using aggregated tag counts for each gene, the ability to call differentially expressed genes between samples is strongly associated with the length of the transcript. Conclusion: Transcript length bias for calling differentially expressed genes is a general feature of current protocols for RNA-seq technology. This has implications for the ranking of differentially expressed genes, and in particular may introduce bias in gene set testing for pathway analysis and other multi-gene systems biology analyses.},

Because so many fields of study lead to careers that involve a decision-making process requiring an understanding of Bayesian methods, it is becoming increasingly clear that Bayesian methods should be included in classes that cover the P value and Hypothesis Testing. We discuss several fallacies associated with the P value and Hypothesis Testing, including why Fisher’s P value and Neyman-Pearson’s Hypothesis Tests are incompatible with each other and cannot be combined to answer the question “What is the probability of the truth of one’s belief based on the evidence?” We go on to explain how the Minimum Bayes Factor can be used as an alternative to frequentist methods, and why the Bayesian approach results in more accurate, credible, and relevant test results when measuring the strength of the evidence. We conclude that educators must realize the importance of teaching the correct interpretation of Fisher’s P value and its alternative, the Bayesian approach, to students in an introductory statistics course.},

  abstract = {It is now well established that noncoding regulatory variants play a central role in the genetics of common diseases and in evolution. However, until recently, we have known little about the mechanisms by which most regulatory variants act. For instance, what types of functional elements in DNA, RNA, or proteins are most often affected by regulatory variants? Which stages of gene regulation are typically altered? How can we predict which variants are most likely to impact regulation in a given cell type? Recent studies, in many cases using quantitative trait loci (QTL)-mapping approaches in cell lines or tissue samples, have provided us with considerable insight into the properties of genetic loci that have regulatory roles. Such studies have uncovered novel biochemical regulatory interactions and led to the identification of previously unrecognized regulatory mechanisms. We have learned that genetic variation is often directly associated with variation in regulatory activities (namely, we can map regulatory QTLs, not just expression QTLs [eQTLs]), and we have taken the first steps towards understanding the causal order of regulatory events (for example, the role of pioneer transcription factors). Yet, in most cases, we still do not know how to interpret overlapping combinations of regulatory interactions, and we are still far from being able to predict how variation in regulatory mechanisms is propagated through a chain of interactions to eventually result in changes in gene expression profiles.},

  abstract = {Background: Sample size planning for longitudinal data is crucial when designing mediation studies because sufficient statistical power is not only required in grant applications and peer-reviewed publications, but is essential to reliable research results. However, sample size determination is not straightforward for mediation analysis of longitudinal design. Methods: To facilitate planning the sample size for longitudinal mediation studies with a multilevel mediation model, this article provides the sample size required to achieve 80\% power by simulations under various sizes of the mediation effect, within-subject correlations and numbers of repeated measures. The sample size calculation is based on three commonly used mediation tests: Sobel’s method, distribution of product method and the bootstrap method. Results: Among the three methods of testing the mediation effects, Sobel’s method required the largest sample size to achieve 80\% power. Bootstrapping and the distribution of the product method performed similarly and were more powerful than Sobel’s method, as reflected by the relatively smaller sample sizes. For all three methods, the sample size required to achieve 80\% power depended on the value of the ICC (i.e., within-subject correlation). A larger value of ICC typically required a larger sample size to achieve 80\% power. Simulation results also illustrated the advantage of the longitudinal study design. The sample size tables for most encountered scenarios in practice have also been published for convenient use. Conclusions: Extensive simulations study showed that the distribution of the product method and bootstrapping method have superior performance to the Sobel’s method, but the product method was recommended to use in practice in terms of less computation time load compared to the bootstrapping method. A R package has been developed for the product method of sample size determination in mediation longitudinal study design.},

In this scenario, public health workers will face the task of providing decision-makers with informa- tion on the cost-effectiveness of introducing the vaccine into regular programs and on the expected impact of this intervention on the health of the population. The goal of this f ield guide is to furnish the basic guidelines for the surveillance of rota- virus disease—since epidemiologic surveillance is the basis for understanding the behavior of diseases in the phase prior to introducing a vaccine into national pro- grams—and also, once the vaccine has been added to the routine series, to evaluate the effectiveness of the program and monitor adverse events supposedly attribut- able to vaccination or immunization (ESAVI). This f ield guide was prepared by the Pan American Health Organization, using the basic principles of the Generic Proto- col for conducting surveillance of rotavirus infection of the WHO Department of Vaccines and Biologicals and with contributions from the countries of the Region, to help the health workers who will conduct the surveillance of this disease in the respective countries. The f ield guide covers clinical and epidemiological aspects, disease burden, laboratory procedures, steps for proper epidemiological investiga- tion, and measures for the prevention and control of rotavirus disease.},

We explored the genomic basis for disease susceptibility and severity. Methods\hspace{0.6em} mRNA sequencing and genotyping in blood from 142 patients with SLE and 58 healthy volunteers. Abundances of cell types were assessed by CIBERSORT and cell-specific effects by interaction terms in linear models. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were used to train classifiers (linear discriminant analysis) of SLE versus healthy individuals in 80\% of the dataset and were validated in the remaining 20\% running 1000 iterations. Transcriptome/genotypes were integrated by expression-quantitative trail loci (eQTL) analysis; tissuespecific genetic causality was assessed by regulatory trait concordance (RTC). Results\hspace{0.6em} SLE has a ’susceptibility signature’ present in patients in clinical remission, an ’activity signature’ linked to genes that regulate immune cell metabolism, protein synthesis and proliferation, and a ’severity signature’ best illustrated in active nephritis, enriched in druggable granulocyte and plasmablast/plasma–cell pathways. Patients with SLE have also perturbed mRNA splicing enriched in immune system and interferon signalling genes. A novel transcriptome index distinguished active versus inactive disease—but not low disease activity—and correlated with disease severity. DEGs discriminate SLE versus healthy individuals with median sensitivity 86\% and specificity 92\% suggesting a potential use in diagnostics. Combined eQTL analysis from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) project and SLE-associated genetic polymorphisms demonstrates that susceptibility variants may regulate gene expression in the blood but also in other tissues. Conclusion\hspace{0.6em} Specific gene networks confer susceptibility to SLE, activity and severity, and may facilitate personalised care.},

The interrelationships can now be better appreciated following the genotyping of large immune disease sample sets on a shared SNP array: the ‘Immunochip’. Here, we systematically analyse loci shared among major immune-mediated diseases. This reveals that several diseases share multiple susceptibility loci, but there are many nuances. The most associated variant at a given locus frequently differs and, even when shared, the same allele often has opposite associations. Interestingly, risk alleles conferring the largest effect sizes are usually disease-specific. These factors help to explain why early evidence of extensive ‘sharing’ is not always reflected in epidemiological overlap.},

We found that smoking, together with age, sex and latent infection with cytomegalovirus, were the main non-genetic factors that affected variation in parameters of human immune cells. Genome-wide association studies of 166 immunophenotypes identified 15 loci that showed enrichment for disease-associated variants. Finally, we demonstrated that the parameters of innate cells were more strongly controlled by genetic variation than were those of adaptive cells, which were driven by mainly environmental exposure.

Although it can be viewed, formally, as a version of Simpson’s paradox (Arah, 2008; Tu et al., 2008; Pearl, 2014b) its reputation has gone much worse. Unlike Simpson’s reversal, Lord’s is easier to state, harder to disentangle (Wainer and Brown, 2007) and, for some reason, it has been lingering for almost four decades, under several interpretations and re-interpretations (Holland and Rubin, 1983), and it keeps coming up in new situations and under new lights (van Breukelen, 2013; Senn, 2006; Eriksson and H¨aggstr¨om, 2014). Most peculiar yet, while some of its variants has received a satisfactory resolution (Glymour, 2006; Herna´ndez-D´ıaz et al., 2006), the original version presented by Lord, to the best of my knowledge, has not been given a proper treatment, not to mention a resolution.},

  abstract = {Background: With progress on both the theoretical and the computational fronts the use of spline modelling has become an established tool in statistical regression analysis. An important issue in spline modelling is the availability of user friendly, well documented software packages. Following the idea of the STRengthening Analytical Thinking for Observational Studies initiative to provide users with guidance documents on the application of statistical methods in observational research, the aim of this article is to provide an overview of the most widely used spline-based techniques and their implementation in R. Methods: In this work, we focus on the R Language for Statistical Computing which has become a hugely popular statistics software. We identified a set of packages that include functions for spline modelling within a regression framework. Using simulated and real data we provide an introduction to spline modelling and an overview of the most popular spline functions. Results: We present a series of simple scenarios of univariate data, where different basis functions are used to identify the correct functional form of an independent variable. Even in simple data, using routines from different packages would lead to different results. Conclusions: This work illustrate challenges that an analyst faces when working with data. Most differences can be attributed to the choice of hyper-parameters rather than the basis used. In fact an experienced user will know how to obtain a reasonable outcome, regardless of the type of spline used. However, many analysts do not have sufficient knowledge to use these powerful tools adequately and will need more guidance.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have transformed our understanding of the genetics of complex traits such as autoimmune diseases, but how risk variants contribute to pathogenesis remains largely unknown. Identifying genetic variants that affect gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci, or eQTLs) is crucial to addressing this. eQTLs vary between tissues and following in vitro cellular activation, but have not been examined in the context of human inflammatory diseases. We performed eQTL mapping in five primary immune cell types from patients with active inflammatory bowel disease (n = 91), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (n = 46) and healthy controls (n = 43), revealing eQTLs present only in the context of active inflammatory disease. Moreover, we show that following treatment a proportion of these eQTLs disappear. Through joint analysis of expression data from multiple cell types, we reveal that previous estimates of eQTL immune cell-type specificity are likely to have been exaggerated. Finally, by analysing gene expression data from multiple cell types, we find eQTLs not previously identified by database mining at 34 inflammatory bowel disease-associated loci. In summary, this parallel eQTL analysis in multiple leucocyte subsets from patients with active disease provides new insights into the genetic basis of immune-mediated diseases.},

  abstract = {Permutation tests are amongst the most commonly used statistical tools in modern genomic research, a process by which p-values are attached to a test statistic by randomly permuting the sample or gene labels. Yet permutation p-values published in the genomic literature are often computed incorrectly, understated by about 1/m, where m is the number of permutations. The same is often true in the more general situation when Monte Carlo simulation is used to assign p-values. Although the p-value understatement is usually small in absolute terms, the implications can be serious in a multiple testing context. The understatement arises from the intuitive but mistaken idea of using permutation to estimate the tail probability of the test statistic. We argue instead that permutation should be viewed as generating an exact discrete null distribution. The relevant literature, some of which is likely to have been relatively inaccessible to the genomic community, is reviewed and summarized. A computation strategy is developed for exact p-values when permutations are randomly drawn. The strategy is valid for any number of permutations and samples. Some simple recommendations are made for the implementation of permutation tests in practice.},

Notably, these vaccines result in significant immune response variability across the population. The mechanism for this variability, in part, appears to lie in the polymorphisms of key immune response genes. Despite the importance of this variability, little in the way of genetic polymorphisms and its association with vaccine immune response to viral vaccines has been performed. Herein, we review and synthesize what is known about the immune response pathway and influenza viral immunity and then present original data from our laboratory on the immunogenetic relationships between HLA, cytokine and cytokine receptor gene polymorphisms and the variations in humoral immune response to inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine. Finally, we propose that a better understanding of vaccine immunogenetics offers insight towards the development of better influenza vaccines.},

Vaccine development, vaccine immunogenicity, and vaccine efficacy have, for the most part, historically been driven by an empiric ‘‘isolate-inactivate-inject” paradigm. In turn, a population-level public health paradigm of ‘‘the same dose for everyone for every disease” model has been the normative thinking in regard to prevention of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases. In addition, up until recently, no vaccines had been designed specifically to overcome the immunosenescence of aging, consistent with a post-WWII mentality of developing vaccines and vaccine programs for children. It is now recognized that the current lack of knowledge concerning how immune responses to vaccines are generated is a critical barrier to understanding poor vaccine responses in the elderly and in immunoimmaturity, discovery of new correlates of vaccine immunogenicity (vaccine response biomarkers), and a directed approach to new vaccine development.},

When using C+T, people usually test several p-value thresholds to maximize predictive ability of derived polygenic scores. Along with this p-value threshold, we propose to tune 3 other hyper-parameters for C+T. We implement an efficient way to derive C+T scores corresponding to many different sets of hyper-parameters. For example, you can now derive thousands of different C+T scores for 300K individuals and 1M variants in less than one day. We show that tuning 4 hyper-parameters of C+T consistently improves its predictive performance in both simulations and real data applications as compared to tuning only the p-value threshold.},

These shifting demographics pose new challenges for vaccination, as emerging evidence suggests that age, the metabolic state, and chronic infections can exert major influences on the immune system. Thus, a key public health challenge is learning how to reprogram suboptimal immune systems to induce effective vaccine immunity. Recent advances have applied systems biological analysis to define molecular signatures induced early after vaccination that correlate with and predict the later adaptive immune responses in humans. Such "systems vaccinology" approaches offer an integrated picture of the molecular networks driving vaccine immunity, and are beginning to yield novel insights about the immune system. Here we discuss the promise of systems vaccinology in probing humanity's diverse immune systems, and in delineating the impact of genes, the environment, and the microbiome on protective immunity induced by vaccination. Such insights will be critical in reengineering suboptimal immune systems in immunocompromised populations.},

Here, we characterized, using RNA sequencing, the transcriptional response of primary monocytes from Africans and Europeans to bacterial and viral stimuli—ligands activating Toll-like receptor pathways (TLR1/2, TLR4, and TLR7/8) and influenza virus—and mapped expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We identify numerous cis-eQTLs that contribute to the marked differences in immune responses detected within and between populations and a strong trans-eQTL hotspot at TLR1 that decreases expression of pro-inflammatory genes in Europeans only. We find that immune-responsive regulatory variants are enriched in population-specific signals of natural selection and show that admixture with Neandertals introduced regulatory variants into European genomes, affecting preferentially responses to viral challenges. Together, our study uncovers evolutionarily important determinants of differences in host immune responsiveness between human populations.},

Where traditionally vaccine development has been dominated by trial and error, systems vaccinology is a tool that provides novel and comprehensive understanding if properly used. Data sets retrieved from systemsbased studies endorse rational design and effective development of safe and efficacious vaccines. In this review we first describe different omicstechniques that form the pillars of systems vaccinology. In the second part, the application of systems vaccinology in the different stages of vaccine development is described. Overall, this review shows that systems vaccinology has become an important tool anywhere in the vaccine development chain.},

  abstract = {Background: High-throughput sequencing is now regularly used for studies of the transcriptome (RNA-seq), particularly for comparisons among experimental conditions. For the time being, a limited number of biological replicates are typically considered in such experiments, leading to low detection power for differential expression. As their cost continues to decrease, it is likely that additional follow-up studies will be conducted to re-address the same biological question. Results: We demonstrate how p-value combination techniques previously used for microarray meta-analyses can be used for the differential analysis of RNA-seq data from multiple related studies. These techniques are compared to a negative binomial generalized linear model (GLM) including a fixed study effect on simulated data and real data on human melanoma cell lines. The GLM with fixed study effect performed well for low inter-study variation and small numbers of studies, but was outperformed by the meta-analysis methods for moderate to large inter-study variability and larger numbers of studies. Conclusions: The p-value combination techniques illustrated here are a valuable tool to perform differential meta-analyses of RNA-seq data by appropriately accounting for biological and technical variability within studies as well as additional study-specific effects. An R package metaRNASeq is available on the CRAN (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/metaRNASeq).},

  abstract = {Background: RNA-seq is now widely used to quantitatively assess gene expression, expression differences and isoform switching, and promises to deliver results for the entire transcriptome. However, whether the transcriptional state of a gene can be captured accurately depends critically on library preparation, read alignment, expression estimation and the tests for differential expression and isoform switching. There are comparisons available for the individual steps but there is not yet a systematic investigation which specific genes are impacted by biases throughout the entire analysis workflow. It is especially unclear whether for a given gene, with current methods and protocols, expression changes and isoform switches can be detected. Results: For the human genes, we report their detectability under various conditions using different approaches. Overall, we find that the input material has the biggest influence and may, depending on the protocol and RNA degradation, exhibit already strong length-dependent over- and underrepresentation of transcripts. The alignment step aligns for 50\% of the isoforms up to 99\% of the reads correctly; only in the presence of transcript modifications mainly short isoforms will have a low alignment rate. In our dataset, we found that, depending on the aligner and the input material used, the expression estimation of up to 93\% of the genes being accurate within a factor of two; with the deviations being due to ambiguous alignments. Detection of differential expression using a negativebinomial count model works reliably for our simulated data but is dependent on the count accuracy. Interestingly, using the fold-change instead of the p-value as a score for differential expression yields the same performance in the situation of three replicates and the true change being two-fold. Isoform switching is harder to detect and for at least 109 genes the isoform differences evade detection independent of the method used. Conclusions: RNA-seq is a reliable tool but the repetitive nature of the human genome makes the origin of the reads ambiguous and limits the detectability for certain genes. RNA-seq does not equally well represent isoforms independent of their size which may range from \textasciitilde 200nt to \textasciitilde 100′000nt. Researchers are advised to verify that their target genes do not have extreme properties with respect to repeated regions, GC content, and isoform length and complexity.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Estimation of between-study heterogeneity is problematic in small meta-analyses. Bayesian meta-analysis is beneficial because it allows incorporation of external evidence on heterogeneity. To facilitate this, we provide empirical evidence on the likely heterogeneity between studies in meta-analyses relating to specific research settings. Study Design and Setting: Our analyses included 6,492 continuous-outcome meta-analyses within the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. We investigated the influence of meta-analysis settings on heterogeneity by modeling study data from all meta-analyses on the standardized mean difference scale. Meta-analysis setting was described according to outcome type, intervention comparison type, and medical area. Predictive distributions for between-study variance expected in future meta-analyses were obtained, which can be used directly as informative priors. Results: Among outcome types, heterogeneity was found to be lowest in meta-analyses of obstetric outcomes. Among intervention comparison types, heterogeneity was lowest in meta-analyses comparing two pharmacologic interventions. Predictive distributions are reported for different settings. In two example meta-analyses, incorporating external evidence led to a more precise heterogeneity estimate. Conclusion: Heterogeneity was influenced by meta-analysis characteristics. Informative priors for between-study variance were derived for each specific setting. Our analyses thus assist the incorporation of realistic prior information into meta-analyses including few studies. Ó 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {limma is an R/Bioconductor software package that provides an integrated solution for analysing data from gene expression experiments. It contains rich features for handling complex experimental designs and for information borrowing to overcome the problem of small sample sizes. Over the past decade, limma has been a popular choice for gene discovery through differential expression analyses of microarray and high-throughput PCR data. The package contains particularly strong facilities for reading, normalizing and exploring such data. Recently, the capabilities of limma have been significantly expanded in two important directions. First, the package can now perform both differential expression and differential splicing analyses of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. All the downstream analysis tools previously restricted to microarray data are now available for RNA-seq as well. These capabilities allow users to analyse both RNA-seq and microarray data with very similar pipelines. Second, the package is now able to go past the traditional gene-wise expression analyses in a variety of ways, analysing expression profiles in terms of co-regulated sets of genes or in terms of higher-order expression signatures. This provides enhanced possibilities for biological interpretation of gene expression differences. This article reviews the philosophy and design of the limma package, summarizing both new and historical features, with an emphasis on recent enhancements and features that have not been previously described.},

  abstract = {Summary: It is expected that emerging digital gene expression (DGE) technologies will overtake microarray technologies in the near future for many functional genomics applications. One of the fundamental data analysis tasks, especially for gene expression studies, involves determining whether there is evidence that counts for a transcript or exon are significantly different across experimental conditions. edgeR is a Bioconductor software package for examining differential expression of replicated count data. An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data., Availability: The package is freely available under the LGPL licence from the Bioconductor web site (http://bioconductor.org)., Contact: mrobinson@wehi.edu.au},

  abstract = {Understanding the differences between microarray and RNA-Seq technologies for measuring gene expression is necessary for informed design of experiments and choice of data analysis methods. Previous comparisons have come to sometimes contradictory conclusions, which we suggest result from a lack of attention to the intensity-dependent nature of variation generated by the technologies. To examine this trend, we carried out a parallel nested experiment performed simultaneously on the two technologies that systematically split variation into four stages (treatment, biological variation, library preparation and chip/lane noise), allowing a separation and comparison of the sources of variation in a well-controlled cellular system, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. With this novel dataset, we demonstrate that power and accuracy are more dependent on pergene read depth in RNA-Seq than they are on fluorescence intensity in microarrays. However, we carried out quantitative PCR validations which indicate that microarrays may demonstrate greater systematic bias in low-intensity genes than in RNA-seq.},

  abstract = {Background: RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has emerged as a powerful approach for the detection of differential gene expression with both high-throughput and high resolution capabilities possible depending upon the experimental design chosen. Multiplex experimental designs are now readily available, these can be utilised to increase the numbers of samples or replicates profiled at the cost of decreased sequencing depth generated per sample. These strategies impact on the power of the approach to accurately identify differential expression. This study presents a detailed analysis of the power to detect differential expression in a range of scenarios including simulated null and differential expression distributions with varying numbers of biological or technical replicates, sequencing depths and analysis methods. Results: Differential and non-differential expression datasets were simulated using a combination of negative binomial and exponential distributions derived from real RNA-Seq data. These datasets were used to evaluate the performance of three commonly used differential expression analysis algorithms and to quantify the changes in power with respect to true and false positive rates when simulating variations in sequencing depth, biological replication and multiplex experimental design choices. Conclusions: This work quantitatively explores comparisons between contemporary analysis tools and experimental design choices for the detection of differential expression using RNA-Seq. We found that the DESeq algorithm performs more conservatively than edgeR and NBPSeq. With regard to testing of various experimental designs, this work strongly suggests that greater power is gained through the use of biological replicates relative to library (technical) replicates and sequencing depth. Strikingly, sequencing depth could be reduced as low as 15\% without substantial impacts on false positive or true positive rates.},

  abstract = {Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that is characterized by chronic inflammation of any part of the gastrointestinal tract, has a progressive and destructive course and is increasing in incidence worldwide. Several factors have been implicated in the cause of Crohn’s disease, including a dysregulated immune system, an altered microbiota, genetic susceptibility and environmental factors, but the cause of the disease remains unknown. The onset of the disease at a young age in most cases necessitates prompt but long-t erm treatment to prevent disease flares and disease progression with intestinal complications. Thus, earlier, more aggressive treatment with biologic therapies or novel small molecules could profoundly change the natural history of the disease and decrease complications and the need for hospitalization and surgery. Although less invasive biomarkers are in development, diagnosis still relies on endoscopy and histological assessment of biopsy specimens. Crohn’s disease is a complex disease, and treatment should be personalized to address the underlying pathogenetic mechanism. In the future, disease management might rely on severity scores that incorporate prognostic factors, bowel damage assessment and non-invasive close monitoring of disease activity to reduce the severity of complications.},

We found multiple associations with canonical traits of all major immune cell subsets and uncovered insights into genetic control for regulatory T cells. This data set also revealed traits associated with loci known to confer autoimmune susceptibility, providing mechanistic hypotheses linking immune traits with the etiology of disease. Our data establish a bioresource that links genetic control elements associated with normal immune traits to common autoimmune and infectious diseases, providing a shortcut to identifying potential mechanisms of immune-related diseases.},

Grid-LMM can compute approximate (yet highly accurate) frequentist test statistics or Bayesian posterior summaries at a genome-wide scale in a fraction of the time compared to existing general-purpose methods. We apply Grid-LMM to two types of quantitative genetic analyses. The first is focused on accounting for spatial variability and non-additive genetic variance while scanning for QTL; and the second aims to identify gene expression traits affected by non-additive genetic variation. In both cases, modeling multiple sources of heterogeneity leads to new discoveries.},

This complexity will most likely require a panoply of drugs targeting different pathways if one wants to treat to steroid-free sustained remission and mucosal healing. Presently, the mainstay of medical management of IBD is based on 5-aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, thiopurines, methotrexate, antitumor necrosis factor, anti-alpha4 beta7 (α4β7) integrin and anti-interleukin (IL)-12/IL-23 therapies. The discovery of new pathways involved in the pathogenesis of IBD resulted in new drugs targeting Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription, IL-6, spingosine-1-phosphate, and phosphodiesterase 4, among others. These new therapies might result in more advantageous safety profiles. Several of these new drugs have already been successfully tested in other inflammatory disorders, such as psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis. In this review, evidence from phase II and phase III randomized controlled clinical trials in patients with IBD involving new biologicals and small molecules are summarized.},

  abstract = {Around a 20–30\% of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients are diagnosed before they are 18 years old. Anti-TNF drugs can induce and maintain remission in IBD, however, up to 30\% of patients do not respond. The aim of the work was to identify markers that would predict an early response to anti-TNF drugs in pediatric patients with IBD. The study population included 43 patients aged {$<$}18 years with IBD who started treatment with infliximab or adalimumab. Patients were classified into primary responders (n = 27) and non-responders to anti-TNF therapy (n = 6). Response to treatment could not be analyzed in 10 patients. Response was defined as a decrease in over 15 points in the disease activity indexes from week 0 to week 10 of infliximab treatment or from week 0 to week 26 of adalimumab treatment. The expression profiles of nine genes in total RNA isolated from the whole-blood of pediatric IBD patients taken before biologic administration and after 2 weeks were analyzed using qPCR and the 2-∆∆Ct method. Before initiation and after 2 weeks of treatment the expression of SMAD7 was decreased in patients who were considered as non-responders (p value {$<$} 0.05). Changes in expression were also observed for TLR2 at T0 and T2, although that did not reach the level of statistical significance. In addition, the expression of DEFA5 decreased 1.75-fold during the first 2 weeks of anti-TNF treatment in responders, whereas no changes were observed in non-responders. Expression of the SMAD7 gene is a pharmacogenomic biomarker of early response to anti-TNF agents in pediatric IBD. TLR2 and DEFA5 need to be validated in larger studies.},

  abstract = {A safe and effective rotavirus vaccine is urgently needed, particularly in developing countries. Critical to vaccine development and implementation is a knowledge base concerning the epidemiology of rotavirus G and P serotypes/genotypes throughout the world. The temporal and geographical distribution of human rotavirus G and P types was reviewed by analysing a total of 45571 strains collected globally from 124 studies reported from 52 countries on five continents published between 1989 and 2004. Four common G types (G1, G2, G3 and G4) in conjunction with P[8] or P[4] represented over 88\% of the strains analysed worldwide. In addition, serotype G9 viruses associated with P[8] or P[6] were shown to have emerged as the fourth globally important G type with the relative frequency of 4.1\%. When the global G and/or P type distributions were divided into five continents/subcontinents, several characteristic features emerged. For example, the P[8]G1 represented over 70\% of rotavirus infections in North America, Europe and Australia, but only about 30\% of the infections in South America and Asia, and 23\% in Africa. In addition, in Africa (i) the relative frequency of G8 was as high as that of the globally common G3 or G4, (ii) P[6] represented almost one-third of all P types identified and (iii) 27\% of the infections were associated with rotavirus strains bearing unusual combinations such as P[6]G8 or P[4]G8. Furthermore, in South America, uncommon G5 virus appeared to increase its epidemiological importance among children with diarrhea. Such findings have (i) confirmed the importance of continued active rotavirus strain surveillance in a variety of geographical settings and (ii) provided important considerations for the development and implementation of an effective rotavirus vaccine (e.g. a geographical P-G type adjustment in the formulation of next generation multivalent vaccines).},

  abstract = {Influenza virus infection is an ongoing health and economic burden causing epidemics with pandemic potential, affecting 5–30\% of the global population annually, and is responsible for millions of hospitalizations and thousands of deaths each year. Annual influenza vaccination is the primary prophylactic countermeasure aimed at limiting influenza burden. However, the effectiveness of current influenza vaccines are limited because they only confer protective immunity when there is antigenic similarity between the selected vaccine strains and circulating influenza isolates. The major targets of the antibody response against influenza virus are the surface glycoprotein antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Hypervariability of the amino acid sequences encoding HA and NA is largely responsible for epidemic and pandemic influenza outbreaks, and are the consequence of antigenic drift or shift, respectively. For this reason, if an antigenic mismatch exists between the current vaccine and circulating influenza isolates, vaccinated people may not be afforded complete protection. There is currently an unmet need to develop an effective “broadly-reactive” or “universal” influenza vaccine capable of conferring protection against both seasonal and newly emerging pre-pandemic strains. A number of novel influenza vaccine approaches are currently under evaluation. One approach is the elicitation of an immune response against the “Achille’s heel” of the virus, i.e. conserved viral proteins or protein regions shared amongst seasonal and prepandemic strains. Alternatively, other approaches aim toward eliciting a broader immune response capable of conferring protection against the diversity of currently circulating seasonal influenza strains. In this review, the most promising under-development universal vaccine approaches are discussed with an emphasis on those targeting the HA glycoprotein. In particular, their strengths and potential short-comings are discussed. Ultimately, the upcoming clinical evaluation of these universal vaccine approaches will be fundamental to determine their effectiveness against preventing influenza virus infection and/or reducing transmission and disease severity.},

  abstract = {Background: Humoral immune responses to infectious agents or vaccination vary substantially among individuals, and many of the factors responsible for this variability remain to be defined. Current evidence suggests that human genetic variation influences (i) serum immunoglobulin levels, (ii) seroconversion rates, and (iii) intensity of antigenspecific immune responses. Here, we evaluated the impact of intrinsic (age and sex), environmental, and genetic factors on the variability of humoral response to common pathogens and vaccines. Methods: We characterized the serological response to 15 antigens from common human pathogens or vaccines, in an age- and sex-stratified cohort of 1000 healthy individuals (Milieu Intérieur cohort). Using clinical-grade serological assays, we measured total IgA, IgE, IgG, and IgM levels, as well as qualitative (serostatus) and quantitative IgG responses to cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, varicella zoster virus, Helicobacter pylori, Toxoplasma gondii, influenza A virus, measles, mumps, rubella, and hepatitis B virus. Following genome-wide genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms and imputation, we examined associations between \textasciitilde{} 5 million genetic variants and antibody responses using single marker and gene burden tests. Results: We identified age and sex as important determinants of humoral immunity, with older individuals and women having higher rates of seropositivity for most antigens. Genome-wide association studies revealed significant associations between variants in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II region on chromosome 6 and anti-EBV and anti-rubella IgG levels. We used HLA imputation to fine map these associations to amino acid variants in the peptide-binding groove of HLA-DRβ1 and HLA-DPβ1, respectively. We also observed significant associations for total IgA levels with two loci on chromosome 2 and with specific KIR-HLA combinations. Conclusions: Using extensive serological testing and genome-wide association analyses in a well-characterized cohort of healthy individuals, we demonstrated that age, sex, and specific human genetic variants contribute to inter-individual variability in humoral immunity. By highlighting genes and pathways implicated in the normal antibody response to frequently encountered antigens, these findings provide a basis to better understand disease pathogenesis.

Considering all human immune cell types and conditions studied, we identified cis-eQTLs for a total of 12,254 unique genes, which represent 61\% of all protein-coding genes expressed in these cell types. Strikingly, a large fraction (41\%) of these genes showed a strong cis-association with genotype only in a single cell type. We also found that biological sex is associated with major differences in immune cell gene expression in a highly cell-specific manner. These datasets will help reveal the effects of disease risk-associated genetic polymorphisms on specific immune cell types, providing mechanistic insights into how they might influence pathogenesis (https://dice-database.org).},

Using three SNP-level fine-mapping methods, we identified 21 SNPs with greater than 50\% probability each of being causally involved in AD risk, and others strongly suggested by functional annotation. We followed this with colocalisation analyses across 109 gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) datasets, and prioritization of genes using protein interaction networks and tissue-specific expression. Combining this information into a quantitative score, we find that evidence converges on likely causal genes, including the above four genes, and those at previously discovered AD loci including BIN1, APH1B, PTK2B, PILRA, and CASS4.},

  abstract = {Background: Standard random-effects meta-analysis methods perform poorly when applied to few studies only. Such settings however are commonly encountered in practice. It is unclear, whether or to what extent small-sample-size behaviour can be improved by more sophisticated modeling. Methods: We consider likelihood-based methods, the DerSimonian-Laird approach, Empirical Bayes, several adjustment methods and a fully Bayesian approach. Confidence intervals are based on a normal approximation, or on adjustments based on the Student-t-distribution. In addition, a linear mixed model and two generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) assuming binomial or Poisson distributed numbers of events per study arm are considered for pairwise binary meta-analyses. We extract an empirical data set of 40 meta-analyses from recent reviews published by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). Methods are then compared empirically as well as in a simulation study, based on few studies, imbalanced study sizes, and considering odds-ratio (OR) and risk ratio (RR) effect sizes. Coverage probabilities and interval widths for the combined effect estimate are evaluated to compare the different approaches. Results: Empirically, a majority of the identified meta-analyses include only 2 studies. Variation of methods or effect measures affects the estimation results. In the simulation study, coverage probability is, in the presence of heterogeneity and few studies, mostly below the nominal level for all frequentist methods based on normal approximation, in particular when sizes in meta-analyses are not balanced, but improve when confidence intervals are adjusted. Bayesian methods result in better coverage than the frequentist methods with normal approximation in all scenarios, except for some cases of very large heterogeneity where the coverage is slightly lower. Credible intervals are empirically and in the simulation study wider than unadjusted confidence intervals, but considerably narrower than adjusted ones, with some exceptions when considering RRs and small numbers of patients per trial-arm. Confidence intervals based on the GLMMs are, in general, slightly narrower than those from other frequentist methods. Some methods turned out impractical due to frequent numerical problems. Conclusions: In the presence of between-study heterogeneity, especially with unbalanced study sizes, caution is needed in applying meta-analytical methods to few studies, as either coverage probabilities might be compromised, or intervals are inconclusively wide.

  abstract = {The case for preferring analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to the simple analysis of change scores (SACS) has often been made. Nevertheless, claims continue to be made that analysis of covariance is biased if the groups are not equal at baseline. If the required equality were in expectation only, this would permit the use of ANCOVA in randomized clinical trials but not in observational studies. The discussion is related to Lord’s paradox. In this note, it is shown, however that it is not a necessary condition for groups to be equal at baseline, not even in expectation, for ANCOVA to provide unbiased estimates of treatment effects. It is also shown that although many situations can be envisaged where ANCOVA is biased it is very difficult to imagine circumstances under which SACS would then be unbiased and a causal interpretation could be made.

We identified SNPs associated with fold change in expression level rather than raw expression levels in the tumor. Following adjustment for false discovery rate, the complete set of probes yielded 9257 significant associations (p b 0.05). We found 18 eQTLs that were missense mutations. Many of the eQTLs in the non-coding regions of a gene, or linked to nearby genes, had large numbers of significant associations (e.g. 321 for RNASE3, 101 for BNC2). Functional enrichment analysis revealed that the expression probes in significant associations were involved in signal transduction, transcription regulation, membrane function, and cell cycle regulation. These results suggest several loci that may serve as hubs in gene regulatory pathways associated with GBM.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Complex diseases are characterized by multiple subtle perturbations to biological processes. New omics platforms can detect these perturbations, but translating the diverse molecular and statistical information into testable mechanistic hypotheses is challenging. Therefore, we set out to create a public tool that integrates these data across multiple datasets, platforms, study designs and species in order to detect the most promising targets for further mechanistic studies. RESULTS We developed Mergeomics, a computational pipeline consisting of independent modules that 1) leverage multi-omics association data to identify biological processes that are perturbed in disease, and 2) overlay the disease-associated processes onto molecular interaction networks to pinpoint hubs as potential key regulators. Unlike existing tools that are mostly dedicated to specific data type or settings, the Mergeomics pipeline accepts and integrates datasets across platforms, data types and species. We optimized and evaluated the performance of Mergeomics using simulation and multiple independent datasets, and benchmarked the results against alternative methods. We also demonstrate the versatility of Mergeomics in two case studies that include genome-wide, epigenome-wide and transcriptome-wide datasets from human and mouse studies of total cholesterol and fasting glucose. In both cases, the Mergeomics pipeline provided statistical and contextual evidence to prioritize further investigations in the wet lab. The software implementation of Mergeomics is freely available as a Bioconductor R package. CONCLUSION Mergeomics is a flexible and robust computational pipeline for multidimensional data integration. It outperforms existing tools, and is easily applicable to datasets from different studies, species and omics data types for the study of complex traits.},

The seven estimators are the variance component type estimator (VC), the method of moments estimator (MM), the maximum likelihood estimator (ML), the restricted maximum likelihood estimator (REML), the empirical Bayes estimator (EB), the model error variance type estimator (MV), and a variation of the MV estimator (MVvc). The performance of the estimators is compared in terms of both bias and mean squared error, using Monte Carlo simulation. The results show that the REML and especially the ML and MM estimators are not accurate, having large biases unless the true heterogeneity variance is small. The VC estimator tends to overestimate the heterogeneity variance in general, but is quite accurate when the number of studies is large. The MV estimator is not a good estimator when the heterogeneity variance is small to moderate, but it is reasonably accurate when the heterogeneity variance is large. The MVvc estimator is an improved estimator compared to the MV estimator, especially for small to moderate values of the heterogeneity variance. The two estimators MVvc and EB are found to be the most accurate in general, particularly when the heterogeneity variance is moderate to large. Copyright q 2006 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

However, for most traits it remains difficult to interpret what genes and biological processes are impacted by the top hits. Here, as a contrast, we describe UK Biobank GWAS results for three molecular traits—urate, IGF-1, and testosterone—that are biologically simpler than most diseases, and for which we know a great deal in advance about the core genes and pathways. Unlike most GWAS of complex traits, for all three traits we find that most top hits are readily interpretable. We observe huge enrichment of significant signals near genes involved in the relevant biosynthesis, transport, or signaling pathways. We show how GWAS data illuminate the biology of variation in each trait, including insights into differences in testosterone regulation between females and males. Meanwhile, in other respects the results are reminiscent of GWAS for more-complex traits. In particular, even these molecular traits are highly polygenic, with most of the variance coming not from core genes, but from thousands to tens of thousands of variants spread across most of the genome. Given that diseases are often impacted by many distinct biological processes, including these three, our results help to illustrate why so many variants can affect risk for any given disease.},

This article introduces linkage disequilibrium, reviews the population genetic processes that affect it and describes some of its uses. At present, linkage disequilibrium is used much more extensively in the study of humans than in non-humans, but that is changing as technological advances make extensive genomic studies feasible in other species.},

In eukaryotes, stable poly(A)-tails, important for mRNA stability and translation initiation, are added to the 30 ends of most nuclear-encoded mRNAs, but not to rRNAs. Contrarily, in prokaryotes and organelles, polyadenylation stimulates RNA degradation. Recently, polyadenylation of nuclear-encoded transcripts in yeast was reported to promote RNA degradation, demonstrating that polyadenylation can play a double-edged role for RNA of nuclear origin. Here we asked whether in human cells ribosomal RNA can undergo polyadenylation. Using both molecular and bioinformatic approaches, we detected nonabundant polyadenylated transcripts of the 18S and 28S rRNAs. Interestingly, many of the posttranscriptionally added tails were composed of heteropolymeric poly(A)-rich sequences containing the other nucleotides in addition to adenosine. These polyadenylated RNA fragments are most likely degradation intermediates, as primer extension (PE) analysis revealed the presence of distal fragmented molecules, some of which matched the polyadenylation sites of the proximal cleavage products revealed by oligo(dT) and circled RT–PCR. These results suggest the presence of a mechanism to degrade ribosomal RNAs in human cells, that possibly initiates with endonucleolytic cleavages and involves the addition of poly(A) or poly(A)-rich tails to truncated transcripts, similar to that which operates in prokaryotes and organelles.},

Here we show that within 24 h of receiving adjuvanted swine flu vaccine, healthy individuals made expansive, complex molecular and cellular responses that included overt lymphoid as well as myeloid contributions. Unexpectedly, this early response was subtly but significantly different in people older than ∼35 years. Wide-ranging adverse clinical events can seriously confound vaccine adoption, but whether there are immunological correlates of these is unknown. Here we identify a molecular signature of adverse events that was commonly associated with an existing B cell phenotype. Thus immunophenotypic variation among healthy humans may be manifest in complex pathophysiological responses.},

  abstract = {Background: Finding genes that are differentially expressed between conditions is an integral part of understanding the molecular basis of phenotypic variation. In the past decades, DNA microarrays have been used extensively to quantify the abundance of mRNA corresponding to different genes, and more recently high-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) has emerged as a powerful competitor. As the cost of sequencing decreases, it is conceivable that the use of RNA-seq for differential expression analysis will increase rapidly. To exploit the possibilities and address the challenges posed by this relatively new type of data, a number of software packages have been developed especially for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. Results: We conducted an extensive comparison of eleven methods for differential expression analysis of RNA-seq data. All methods are freely available within the R framework and take as input a matrix of counts, i.e. the number of reads mapping to each genomic feature of interest in each of a number of samples. We evaluate the methods based on both simulated data and real RNA-seq data. Conclusions: Very small sample sizes, which are still common in RNA-seq experiments, impose problems for all evaluated methods and any results obtained under such conditions should be interpreted with caution. For larger sample sizes, the methods combining a variance-stabilizing transformation with the ‘limma’ method for differential expression analysis perform well under many different conditions, as does the nonparametric SAMseq method.},

  abstract = {High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is used extensively to characterize the transcriptome of cells. Many transcriptomic studies aim at comparing either abundance levels or the transcriptome composition between given conditions, and as a first step, the sequencing reads must be used as the basis for abundance quantification of transcriptomic features of interest, such as genes or transcripts. Various quantification approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple counting of reads that overlap given genomic regions to more complex estimation of underlying transcript abundances. In this paper, we show that gene-level abundance estimates and statistical inference offer advantages over transcript-level analyses, in terms of performance and interpretability. We also illustrate that the presence of differential isoform usage can lead to inflated false discovery rates in differential gene expression analyses on simple count matrices but that this can be addressed by incorporating offsets derived from transcript-level abundance estimates. We also show that the problem is relatively minor in several real data sets. Finally, we provide an R package ( tximport) to help users integrate transcript-level abundance estimates from common quantification pipelines into count-based statistical inference engines.},

The present simulation study shows that, if used to analyze the effect of change in X on Y, there is a high risk for this analysis to produce type 1-errors, especially with a strong correlation between true X and Y, when X0 and X1 are not measured with very high reliability, and with a large sample size. These problems are not encountered if analyzing the unadjusted effect of the X1-X0 difference on Y instead, and as this effect exhibits power on par with the adjusted effect it seems as the preferable method when using change between two measurement points as a predictor.},

However, whether these variants function in specific cell states or stages of cell activation is unknown. We stimulated T cells and macrophages in the presence of thirteen different cytokine cocktails linked to immune diseases and profiled active enhancers and promoters together with regions of open chromatin. We observed that T cell activation induced major chromatin remodelling, while additional exposure to cytokines fine-tuned the magnitude of these changes. Therefore, we developed a new statistical method that accounts for subtle changes in chromatin landscape to identify SNP enrichment across cell states. Our results point towards the role of immune disease variants in early rather than late activation of memory CD4+ T cells, and with limited differences across polarizing cytokines. Furthermore, we demonstrate that inflammatory bowel disease variants are enriched in chromatin regions active in Th1 cells, while asthma variants overlap regions active in Th2 cells. We also show that Alzheimer’s disease variants are enriched in different macrophage cell states. Our results represent the first in-depth analysis of immune disease variants across a comprehensive panel of activation states of T cells and macrophages.},

  abstract = {Gene expression measurements are influenced by a wide range of factors, such as the state of the cell, experimental conditions and variants in the sequence of regulatory regions. To understand the effect of a variable of interest, such as the genotype of a locus, it is important to account for variation that is due to confounding causes. Here, we present VBQTL, a probabilistic approach for mapping expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that jointly models contributions from genotype as well as known and hidden confounding factors. VBQTL is implemented within an efficient and flexible inference framework, making it fast and tractable on large-scale problems. We compare the performance of VBQTL with alternative methods for dealing with confounding variability on eQTL mapping datasets from simulations, yeast, mouse, and human. Employing Bayesian complexity control and joint modelling is shown to result in more precise estimates of the contribution of different confounding factors resulting in additional associations to measured transcript levels compared to alternative approaches. We present a threefold larger collection of cis eQTLs than previously found in a whole-genome eQTL scan of an outbred human population. Altogether, 27\% of the tested probes show a significant genetic association in cis, and we validate that the additional eQTLs are likely to be real by replicating them in different sets of individuals. Our method is the next step in the analysis of high-dimensional phenotype data, and its application has revealed insights into genetic regulation of gene expression by demonstrating more abundant cis-acting eQTLs in human than previously shown.

The inferred factors are used in genetic association analyses. First, they are treated as additional covariates, and are included in the model to increase detection power for mapping expression traits.

This problem arises in many settings, including genetic association studies, where the explanatory variable is genotype at a genetic variant. We outline a framework for conducting this type of analysis, based on Bayesian model comparison and model averaging for multivariate regressions. This framework unifies several common approaches to this problem, and includes both standard univariate and standard multivariate association tests as special cases. The framework also unifies the problems of testing for associations and explaining associations – that is, identifying which outcome variables are associated with genotype. This provides an alternative to the usual, but conceptually unsatisfying, approach of resorting to univariate tests when explaining and interpreting significant multivariate findings. The method is computationally tractable genome-wide for modest numbers of phenotypes (e.g. 5–10), and can be applied to summary data, without access to raw genotype and phenotype data. We illustrate the methods on both simulated examples, and to a genome-wide association study of blood lipid traits where we identify 18 potential novel genetic associations that were not identified by univariate analyses of the same data.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale hypothesis testing, including estimating false discovery rates (FDRs), and effect sizes. This approach has two key differences from existing approaches to FDR analysis. First, it assumes that the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects is unimodal, with a mode at 0. This “unimodal assumption” (UA), although natural in many contexts, is not usually incorporated into standard FDR analysis, and we demonstrate how incorporating it brings many benefits. Specifically, the UA facilitates efficient and robust computation—estimating the unimodal distribution involves solving a simple convex optimization problem—and enables more accurate inferences provided that it holds. Second, the method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an effect size estimate and corresponding standard error), rather than the one number usually used (p value or z score). When available, using two numbers instead of one helps account for variation in measurement precision across tests. It also facilitates estimation of effects, and unlike standard FDR methods, our approach provides interval estimates (credible regions) for each effect in addition to measures of significance. To provide a bridge between interval estimates and significance measures, we introduce the term “local false sign rate” to refer to the probability of getting the sign of an effect wrong and argue that it is a superior measure of significance than the local FDR because it is both more generally applicable and can be more robustly estimated. Our methods are implemented in an R package ashr available from http://github.com/stephens999/ashr.},

  abstract = {Background: Multiple pathway databases are available that describe the human metabolic network and have proven their usefulness in many applications, ranging from the analysis and interpretation of high-throughput data to their use as a reference repository. However, so far the various human metabolic networks described by these databases have not been systematically compared and contrasted, nor has the extent to which they differ been quantified. For a researcher using these databases for particular analyses of human metabolism, it is crucial to know the extent of the differences in content and their underlying causes. Moreover, the outcomes of such a comparison are important for ongoing integration efforts. Results: We compared the genes, EC numbers and reactions of five frequently used human metabolic pathway databases. The overlap is surprisingly low, especially on reaction level, where the databases agree on 3\% of the 6968 reactions they have combined. Even for the well-established tricarboxylic acid cycle the databases agree on only 5 out of the 30 reactions in total. We identified the main causes for the lack of overlap. Importantly, the databases are partly complementary. Other explanations include the number of steps a conversion is described in and the number of possible alternative substrates listed. Missing metabolite identifiers and ambiguous names for metabolites also affect the comparison. Conclusions: Our results show that each of the five networks compared provides us with a valuable piece of the puzzle of the complete reconstruction of the human metabolic network. To enable integration of the networks, next to a need for standardizing the metabolite names and identifiers, the conceptual differences between the databases should be resolved. Considerable manual intervention is required to reach the ultimate goal of a unified and biologically accurate model for studying the systems biology of human metabolism. Our comparison provides a stepping stone for such an endeavor.},

Over the past 10 years, new approaches using mixed models have emerged to mitigate the deleterious effects of population structure and relatedness in association studies. However, developing GWAS techniques to accurately test for association while correcting for population structure is a computational and statistical challenge. Using laboratory mouse strains as an example, our review characterizes the problem of population structure in association studies and describes how it can cause false positive associations. We then motivate mixed models in the context of unmodeled factors.},

  abstract = {Findings from clinical and biological studies are often not reproducible when tested in independent cohorts. Due to the testing of a large number of hypotheses and relatively small sample sizes, results from whole-genome expression studies in particular are often not reproducible. Compared to singlestudy analysis, gene expression meta-analysis can improve reproducibility by integrating data from multiple studies. However, there are multiple choices in designing and carrying out a meta-analysis. Yet, clear guidelines on best practices are scarce. Here, we hypothesized that studying subsets of very large meta-analyses would allow for systematic identification of best practices to improve reproducibility. We therefore constructed three very large gene expression meta-analyses from clinical samples, and then examined meta-analyses of subsets of the datasets (all combinations of datasets with up to N/2 samples and K/2 datasets) compared to a ‘silver standard’ of differentially expressed genes found in the entire cohort. We tested three random-effects meta-analysis models using this procedure. We showed relatively greater reproducibility with more-stringent effect size thresholds with relaxed significance thresholds; relatively lower reproducibility when imposing extraneous constraints on residual heterogeneity; and an underestimation of actual false positive rate by Benjamini–Hochberg correction. In addition, multivariate regression showed that the accuracy of a meta-analysis increased significantly with more included datasets even when controlling for sample size.},

  abstract = {Background: One dose of pandemic influenza vaccine Pandemrix (GlaxoSmithKline) was offered to the entire population of Finland in 2009–10. We conducted a prospective clinical cohort study to determine the vaccine effectiveness in preventing febrile laboratory-confirmed influenza infection during the influenza season 2009–10 and continued the study in 2010–11. Methods: In total, 3,518 community dwelling adults aged 18–75 years living in Tampere city were enrolled. The participants were not assigned to any vaccination regimen, but they could participate in the study regardless of their vaccination status or intention to be vaccinated with the pandemic or seasonal influenza vaccine. They were asked to report if they received Pandemrix in 2009–10 and/or trivalent influenza vaccine in 2010–11. Vaccinations were verified from medical records. The participants were instructed to report all acute symptoms of respiratory tract infection with fever (at least 38uC) and pneumonias to the study staff. Nasal and oral swabs were obtained within 5–7 days after symptom onset and influenzaspecific RNA was identified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: In 2009–10, the estimated vaccine effectiveness was 81\% (95\%CI 30–97). However, the vaccine effectiveness could not be estimated reliably, because only persons in prioritized groups were vaccinated before/during the first pandemic wave and many participants were enrolled when they already had the symptoms of A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza infection. In 2010–11, 2,276 participants continued the follow-up. The vaccine effectiveness, adjusted for potential confounding factors was 81\% (95\%CI 41–96) for Pandemrix only and 88\% (95\%CI 63–97) for either Pandemrix or trivalent influenza vaccine 2010–11 or both, respectively. Conclusion: Vaccination with an AS03-adjuvanted pandemic vaccine in 2009–10 was still effective in preventing A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza during the following epidemic season in 2010–11.},

  abstract = {Abstract           The UK Biobank Exome Sequencing Consortium (UKB-ESC) is a unique private/public partnership between the UK Biobank and eight biopharma companies that will sequence the exomes of all ∼500,000 UK Biobank participants. Here we describe early results from the exome sequence data generated by this consortium for the first ∼200,000 UKB subjects and the key features of this project that enabled the UKB-ESC to come together and generate this data.           Exome sequencing data from the first 200,643 UKB enrollees are now accessible to the research community. Approximately 10M variants were observed within the targeted regions, including: 8,086,176 SNPs, 370,958 indels and 1,596,984 multi-allelic variants. Of the ∼8M variants observed, 84.5\% are coding variants and include 2,139,318 (25.3\%) synonymous, 4,549,694 (53.8\%) missense, 453,733 (5.4\%) predicted loss-of-function (LOF) variants (initiation codon loss, premature stop codons, stop codon loss, splicing and frameshift variants) affecting at least one coding transcript. This open access data provides a rich resource of coding variants for rare variant genetic studies, and is particularly valuable for drug discovery efforts that utilize rare, functionally consequential variants.           Over the past decade, the biopharma industry has increasingly leveraged human genetics as part of their drug discovery and development strategies. This shift was motivated by technical advances that enabled cost-effective human genetics research at scale, the emergence of electronic health records and biobanks, and a maturing understanding of how human genetics can increase the probability of successful drug development. Recognizing the need for large-scale human genetics data to drive drug discovery, and the unique value of the open data access policies and contribution terms of the UK Biobank, the UKB-ESC was formed. This precompetitive collaboration has further strengthened the ties between academia and industry and provided teams an unprecedented opportunity to interact with and learn from the wider research community.},

The initial phases of the program focus on whole genome sequencing of individuals with rich phenotypic data and diverse backgrounds. Here, we describe TOPMed goals and design as well as resources and early insights from the sequence data. The resources include a variant browser, a genotype imputation panel, and sharing of genomic and phenotypic data via dbGaP. In 53,581 TOPMed samples, {$>$}400 million single-nucleotide and insertion/deletion variants were detected by alignment with the reference genome. Additional novel variants are detectable through assembly of unmapped reads and customized analysis in highly variable loci. Among the {$>$}400 million variants detected, 97\% have frequency {$<$}1\% and 46\% are singletons. These rare variants provide insights into mutational processes and recent human evolutionary history. The nearly complete catalog of genetic variation in TOPMed studies provides unique opportunities for exploring the contributions of rare and non-coding sequence variants to phenotypic variation. Furthermore, combining TOPMed haplotypes with modern imputation methods improves the power and extends the reach of nearly all genome-wide association studies to include variants down to \textasciitilde 0.01\% in frequency.},

  abstract = {Genome-w ide association studies (GWAS) involve testing genetic variants across the genomes of many individuals to identify genotype–phenotype associations. GWAS have revolutionized the field of complex disease genetics over the past decade, providing numerous compelling associations for human complex traits and diseases. Despite clear successes in identifying novel disease susceptibility genes and biological pathways and in translating these findings into clinical care, GWAS have not been without controversy. Prominent criticisms include concerns that GWAS will eventually implicate the entire genome in disease predisposition and that most association signals reflect variants and genes with no direct biological relevance to disease. In this Review, we comprehensively assess the benefits and limitations of GWAS in human populations and discuss the relevance of performing more GWAS.},

  abstract = {Vaccines are very effective at preventing infectious disease but not all recipients mount a protective immune response to vaccination. Recently, gene expression profiles of PBMC samples in vaccinated individuals have been used to predict the development of protective immunity. However, the magnitude of change in gene expression that separates vaccine responders and nonresponders is likely to be small and distributed across networks of genes, making the selection of predictive and biologically relevant genes difficult. Here we apply a new approach to predicting vaccine response based on coordinated upregulation of sets of biologically informative genes in postvaccination gene expression profiles. We found that enrichment of gene sets related to proliferation and immunoglobulin genes accurately segregated high responders to influenza vaccination from low responders and achieved a prediction accuracy of 88\% in an independent clinical trial. Many of the genes in these gene sets would not have been identified using conventional, single-gene level approaches because of their subtle upregulation in vaccine responders. Our results demonstrate that gene set enrichment method can capture subtle transcriptional changes and may be a generally useful approach for developing and interpreting predictive models of the human immune response.},

  abstract = {Identification of functional sets of genes associated with conditions of interest from omics data was first reported in 1999, and since, a plethora of enrichment methods were published for systematic analysis of gene sets collections including Gene Ontology and biological pathways. Despite their widespread usage in reducing the complexity of omics experiment results, their performance is poorly understood. Leveraging the existence of disease specific gene sets in KEGG and MetacoreH databases, we compared the performance of sixteen methods under relaxed assumptions while using 42 real datasets (over 1,400 samples). Most of the methods ranked high the gene sets designed for specific diseases whenever samples from affected individuals were compared against controls via microarrays. The top methods for gene set prioritization were different from the top ones in terms of sensitivity, and four of the sixteen methods had large false positives rates assessed by permuting the phenotype of the samples. The best overall methods among those that generated reasonably low false positive rates, when permuting phenotypes, were PLAGE, GLOBALTEST, and PADOG. The best method in the category that generated higher than expected false positives was MRGSE.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Rotavirus vaccine is recommended for routine use in all countries globally. To facilitate decision making on rotavirus vaccine adoption by countries, help donors prioritize investments in health interventions, and monitor vaccine impact, we estimated rotavirus mortality for children {$<$}5 years of age from 2000 to 2013. METHODS We searched PubMed using the keyword "rotavirus" to identify studies that met each of the following criteria: data collection midpoint in year 1998 or later, study period of a 12-month increment, and detection of rotavirus infection by enzyme immunoassay in at least 100 children {$<$}5 years of age who were hospitalized with diarrhea and systematically enrolled through active surveillance. We also included data from countries that participated in the World Health Organization (WHO)-coordinated rotavirus surveillance network between 2008 and 2013 that met these criteria. To predict the proportion of diarrhea due to rotavirus, we constructed a multiple linear regression model. To determine the number of rotavirus deaths in children {$<$}5 years of age from 2000 to 2013, we multiplied annual, country-specific estimates of the proportion of diarrhea due to rotavirus from the regression model by the annual number of WHO-estimated child deaths caused by diarrhea in each country. RESULTS Globally, we estimated that the number of rotavirus deaths in children {$<$}5 years of age declined from 528 000 (range, 465 000-591 000) in 2000 to 215 000 (range, 197 000-233 000) in 2013. The predicted annual rotavirus detection rate from these studies declined slightly over time from 42.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 37.4\%-47.5\%) in 2000 to 37.3\% (95\% CI, 34.2\%-40.5\%) in 2013 globally. In 2013, an estimated 47 100 rotavirus deaths occurred in India, 22\% of all rotavirus deaths that occurred globally. Four countries (India, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Democratic Republic of Congo) accounted for approximately half (49\%) of all estimated rotavirus deaths in 2013. DISCUSSION While rotavirus vaccine had been introduced in {$>$}60 countries worldwide by the end of 2013, the majority of countries using rotavirus vaccine during the review period were low-mortality countries and the impact of rotavirus vaccine on global estimates of rotavirus mortality has been limited. Continued monitoring of rotavirus mortality rates and deaths through rotavirus surveillance will aid in monitoring the impact of vaccination.},

This paper summarizes statistical methods commonly applied and strait forward to use for conducting MR analyses including those taking advantage of the rich dataset of SNP-trait associations that were revealed in the last decade through large-scale genome-wide association studies. Using these data, powerful MR studies are possible. However, the causal estimate may be biased in case the assumptions of MR are violated. The source and the type of this bias are described while providing a summary of the mathematical formulas that should help estimating the magnitude and direction of the potential bias depending on the specific research setting. Finally, methods for relaxing the assumptions and for conducting sensitivity analyses are discussed. Future researches in the field of MR include the assessment of non-linear causal effects, and automatic detection of invalid instruments.},

  abstract = {There is increasing evidence that genome-wide association (GWA) studies represent a powerful approach to the identification of genes involved in common human diseases. We describe a joint GWA study (using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British population, which has examined approximately 2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of approximately 3,000 controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association signals at P {$<$} 5 x 10(-7): 1 in bipolar disorder, 1 in coronary artery disease, 9 in Crohn's disease, 3 in rheumatoid arthritis, 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of prior findings and replication studies thus-far completed, almost all of these signals reflect genuine susceptibility effects. We observed association at many previously identified loci, and found compelling evidence that some loci confer risk for more than one of the diseases studied. Across all diseases, we identified a large number of further signals (including 58 loci with single-point P values between 10(-5) and 5 x 10(-7)) likely to yield additional susceptibility loci. The importance of appropriately large samples was confirmed by the modest effect sizes observed at most loci identified. This study thus represents a thorough validation of the GWA approach. It has also demonstrated that careful use of a shared control group represents a safe and effective approach to GWA analyses of multiple disease phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype database for future studies of common diseases in the British population; and shown that, provided individuals with non-European ancestry are excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British population is generally modest. Our findings offer new avenues for exploring the pathophysiology of these important disorders. We anticipate that our data, results and software, which will be widely available to other investigators, will provide a powerful resource for human genetics research.},

Early findings, however, revealed a more complex genetic architecture than was anticipated for most common diseases — complexity that seemed to limit the immediate utility of these findings. As a result, the practice of utilizing the DNA of an individual to predict disease has been judged to provide little to no useful information. Nevertheless, recent efforts have begun to demonstrate the utility of polygenic risk profiling to identify groups of individuals who could benefit from the knowledge of their probabilistic susceptibility to disease. In this context, we review the evidence supporting the personal and clinical utility of polygenic risk profiling.},

Research on the complex biology of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) has uncovered many mechanisms and pathways by which TNF may be involved in the pathogenesis of these diseases. There are 3 TNF antagonists currently available: adalimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody; etanercept, a soluble receptor construct; and infliximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody. Two other TNF antagonists, certolizumab and golimumab, are in clinical development.The remarkable efficacy of TNF antagonists in these diseases places TNF in the center of our understanding of the pathogenesis of many immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. The purpose of this review is to discuss the biology of TNF and related family members in the context of the potential mechanisms of action of TNF antagonists in a variety of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases. Possible mechanistic differences between TNF antagonists are addressed with regard to their efficacy and safety profiles. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Identification of the MHC variants conferring susceptibility to disease is problematic, due to high levels of variation and linkage disequilibrium. Recent cataloguing and analysis of variation over the complete MHC has facilitated localization of susceptibility loci for autoimmune diseases, and provided insight into the MHC’s evolution. This review considers how the unusual genetic characteristics of the MHC impact on strategies to identify variants causing, or contributing to, disease phenotypes. It also considers the MHC in relation to novel mechanisms influencing gene function and regulation, such as epistasis, epigenetics and microRNAs. These developments, along with recent technological advances, shed light on genetic association in complex disease.},

  abstract = {In spite of current influenza vaccines being immunogenic, evolution of the influenza virus can reduce efficacy and so influenza remains a major threat to public health. One approach to improve influenza vaccines is to include adjuvants; substances that boost the immune response. Adjuvants are particularly beneficial for influenza vaccines administered during a pandemic when a rapid response is required or for use in patients with impaired immune responses, such as infants and the elderly. This review outlines the current use of adjuvants in human influenza vaccines, including what they are, why they are used and what is known of their mechanism of action. To date, six adjuvants have been used in licensed human vaccines: Alum, MF59, AS03, AF03, virosomes and heat labile enterotoxin (LT). In general these adjuvants are safe and well tolerated, but there have been some rare adverse events when adjuvanted vaccines are used at a population level that may discourage the inclusion of adjuvants in influenza vaccines, for example the association of LT with Bell’s Palsy. Improved understanding about the mechanisms of the immune response to vaccination and infection has led to advances in adjuvant technology and we describe the experimental adjuvants that have been tested in clinical trials for influenza but have not yet progressed to licensure. Adjuvants alone are not sufficient to improve influenza vaccine efficacy because they do not address the underlying problem of mismatches between circulating virus and the vaccine. However, they may contribute to improved efficacy of next-generation influenza vaccines and will most likely play a role in the development of effective universal influenza vaccines, though what that role will be remains to be seen.},

Constructing such models requires the collection of dense measurements of system states, yet transformation of data into predictive constructs remains a challenge. To begin to model human immunity, we analyzed immune parameters in depth both at baseline and in response to influenza vaccination. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell transcriptomes, serum titers, cell subpopulation frequencies, and B cell responses were assessed in 63 individuals before and after vaccination and were used to develop a systematic framework to dissect inter- and intra-individual variation and build predictive models of postvaccination antibody responses. Strikingly, independent of age and pre-existing antibody titers, accurate models could be constructed using pre-perturbation cell populations alone, which were validated using independent baseline time points. Most of the parameters contributing to prediction delineated temporally stable baseline differences across individuals, raising the prospect of immune monitoring before intervention. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

In particular, given the prevalent involvement of the immune system in diverse pathologies, an important question is how much and what information about the state of the immune system is required to enable accurate prediction of future health and response to medical interventions. Towards addressing this question, recent studies using vaccination as a model perturbation and systems-biology approaches are beginning to provide a glimpse of how natural population variation together with multiplexed, high-throughput measurement and computational analysis can be used to uncover predictors of immune response quality in humans. Here I discuss recent developments in this emerging field, with emphasis on baseline correlates of vaccination responses, sources of immune-state variability, as well as relevant features of study design, data generation, and computational analysis.},

Many such GWAS involve multiple closely-related phenotypes collected on the same samples. However, the vast majority of these GWAS have been analyzed using simple univariate analyses, which consider one phenotype at a time. This is despite the fact that, at least in simulation experiments, multivariate analyses have been shown to be more powerful at detecting associations. Here, we conduct multivariate association analyses on 13 different publicly-available GWAS datasets that involve multiple closely-related phenotypes. These data include large studies of anthropometric traits (GIANT), plasma lipid traits (GlobalLipids), and red blood cell traits (HaemgenRBC). Our analyses identify many new associations (433 in total across the 13 studies), many of which replicate when follow-up samples are available. Overall, our results demonstrate that multivariate analyses can help make more effective use of data from both existing and future GWAS.},

This data comes from many diverse measurement platforms that make integrating it all difficult. In this paper, we propose a new method for processing RNA-sequencing data that yields gene expression estimates that are much more similar to corresponding estimates from microarray data, hence greatly improving cross-platform comparability. The method we call PREBS is based on estimating the expression only from microarray probe regions, and processing these estimates with microarray summarisation algorithm RMA. This allows new ways of using RNA-sequencing data, such as expression estimation for microarray probe sets. Gene signatures defined based on PREBS expression measures of RNA-sequencing data are much more accurate for retrieval of similar microarray samples from a database.},

Repeated administration of mAbs, however, elicits an immune response in the form of anti-drug-antibodies (ADA), thereby reducing the drug’s efficacy. Notwithstanding their importance, the molecular landscape of ADA and the mechanisms involved in their formation are not fully understood. Using a newly developed quantitative bio-immunoassay, we found that ADA concentrations specific to TNFα antagonists can exceed extreme concentrations of 1 mg/ml with a wide range of neutralization capacity. Our data further suggest a preferential use of the λ light chain in a subset of neutralizing ADA. Moreover, we show that administration of TNFα antagonists result in a vaccine-like response whereby ADA formation is governed by the extrafollicular T cell-independent immune response. Our bio-immunoassay coupled with insights on the nature of the immune response can be leveraged to improve mAb immunogenicity assessment and facilitate improvement in therapeutic intervention strategies.},

  abstract = {Background and Objective: For inferring a treatment effect from the difference between a treated and untreated group on a quantitative outcome measured before and after treatment, current methods are analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) of the outcome with the baseline as covariate, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) of change from baseline. This article compares both methods on power and bias, for randomized and nonrandomized studies. Methods: The methods are compared by writing both as a regression model and as a repeated measures model, and are applied to a nonrandomized study of preventing depression. Results: In randomized studies both methods are unbiased, but ANCOVA has more power. If treatment assignment is based on the baseline, only ANCOVA is unbiased. In nonrandomized studies with preexisting groups differing at baseline, the two methods cannot both be unbiased, and may contradict each other. In the study of depression, ANCOVA suggests absence, but ANOVA of change suggests presence, of a treatment effect. The methods differ because ANCOVA assumes absence of a baseline difference. Conclusion: In randomized studies and studies with treatment assignment depending on the baseline, ANCOVA must be used. In nonrandomized studies of preexisting groups, ANOVA of change seems less biased than ANCOVA, but two control groups and two baseline measurements are recommended. Ó 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The enormous increase in throughput and reduction in cost per cell now allow this technology to be applied to large-scale population genetics studies. Therefore, we have founded the single-cell eQTLGen consortium (sc-eQTLGen), aimed at pinpointing disease-causing genetic variants and identifying the cellular contexts in which they affect gene expression. Ultimately, this information can enable development of personalized medicine. Here, we outline the goals, approach, potential utility and early proofs-of-concept of the sc-eQTLGen consortium.

These new insights have revolutionized our approach to resolve the genetic variation underlying complex diseases. Gene transcript levels were the first expression phenotypes that were studied. They are heritable and therefore amenable to genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The genetic variants that modulate them are called expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). Their study has been extended to other molecular quantitative trait loci (molQTL) that regulate gene expression at the various levels, from chromatin state to cellular responses. Altogether, these studies have generated a wealth of basic information on the genome-wide patterns of gene expression and their inter-individual variation. Most importantly, molQTLs have become an invaluable asset in the genetic study of complex diseases. Although the identification of the disease-causing variants on the basis of their overlap with molQTLs requires caution, molQTLs can help prioritize the relevant candidate gene(s) in the disease-associated regions and bring a functional interpretation of the associated variants, therefore bridging the gap between genotypes and clinical phenotypes.},

  abstract = {For 5 years, we have conducted sentinel surveillance for rotavirus at 6 hospitals in 4 cities in Vietnam. Stool samples obtained from {$>$}10,000 children {$<$}5 years old who were admitted to the hospital with diarrhea have been screened for rotavirus. Overall, 55\% of samples were positive, and there was little variability in rates of detection of rotavirus between sites (44\%-62\%). In Vietnam, the characteristics of rotavirus infection more closely resemble those seen in developed countries, rather than those seen in developing countries: children become infected at an older age, the percentage of stool samples in which rotavirus is detected is extremely high, and the rotavirus strains appear to be the common types, with fewer mixed infections occurring. It is estimated that 5300-6800 children {$<$}5 years old die of rotavirus infection each year in Vietnam, representing 8\%-11\% of all deaths in this age group (cumulative risk per child by age 5 years, 1 in 200 to 1 in 285). Additional studies are ongoing to document the economic cost of the disease and to assess the burden of both fatal cases and milder cases of disease. Study outcomes will provide information for future testing and potential use of a rotavirus vaccine.},

  abstract = {Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. Treatment options include biologic therapies; however, a proportion of patients lose response to biologics, partly due to the formation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAbs). Concomitant immunosuppressive agents reduce the development of ADAbs. This review article aims to assess the immunogenicity of biologic therapies and their clinical implications. A comprehensive literature search was conducted for articles published January 2009 to August 2015 reporting immunogenicity to adalimumab (ADM), certolizumab pegol (CZP), golimumab, infliximab (IFX), ustekinumab, and vedolizumab in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Eligible articles were reviewed and quality assessed by independent reviewers. Overall, 122 publications reporting 114 studies were assessed. ADAbs were reported for all agents, but the percentage of patients developing ADAbs was extremely variable, with the highest (65.3\%) being for IFX administration to patients with IBD. ADAb presence was frequently associated with a reduction in primary efficacy and a loss of response, and, for IFX, an increase in adverse events (AEs). Lower serum levels of ADM, CZP and IFX were seen in ADAbs-positive rather than ADAbs-negative patients; pharmacokinetic data were unavailable for other therapies. Little information was available regarding the timing of ADAb development; studies reported their detection from as early as 10–14 days up to months after treatment initiation. Biologic therapies carry an intrinsic risk of immunogenicity, although reported rates of ADAbs vary considerably. The clinical implications of immunogenicity are a concern for effective treatment; further research, particularly into the more recently approved biologics, is required.},

  abstract = {Live attenuated oral rotavirus vaccines were tested for proof-of-concept in the early 1980s, the first vaccine (RotaShield®, Wyeth) was introduced in 1998 but was subsequently withdrawn because of association with intussusception, and the two currently licensed vaccine (Rotarix®, GlaxoSmithKline, and RotaTeq®, Merck) were introduced in 2006. Before licensure both vaccines were extensively tested for safety (for intussusception) and efficacy in trials comprising in over 60 000 infants each. Rotarix is a single-strain human rotavirus vaccine (RV1) and RotaTeq is a combination of five bovine–human reassortant rotaviruses (RV5). Although the composition of the two vaccines is different, their field effectiveness and, largely, mechanism of action are similar. Both prevent effectively severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (RVGE) but are less efficacious against mild RVGE or rotavirus infection. Field effectiveness of these vaccines in Europe and the USA against severe RVGE has been above 90\% and in Latin America around 80\%. Trials in Africa have yielded efficacy rates between 50 and 80\%. Rotavirus vaccination has been introduced into the national immunization programmes of about 20 countries in Latin America, with Brazil and Mexico as leading countries, as well as in the USA, Australia and South Africa. Introduction into other African countries will start in 2012. In Europe, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria and Finland and five federal states of Germany have introduced universal rotavirus vaccination. The reasons for the slow progress in Europe include low mortality from RVGE, unfavourable cost–benefit calculations in some countries, and concerns that still exist over intussusception.},

  abstract = {Given the many cell types and molecular components of the human immune system, along with vast variations across individuals, how should we go about developing causal and predictive explanations of immunity? A central strategy in human studies is to leverage natural variation to find relationships among variables, including DNA variants, epigenetic states, immune phenotypes, clinical descriptors, and others. Here, we focus on how natural variation is used to find patterns, infer principles, and develop predictive models for two areas: (a) immune cell activation—how single-cell profiling boosts our ability to discover immune cell types and states—and (b) antigen presentation and recognition—how models can be generated to predict presentation of antigens on MHC molecules and their detection by T cell receptors. These are two examples of a shift in how we find the drivers and targets of immunity, especially in the human system in the context of health and disease.},

However, many key tissues and cell-types required for appropriate functional inference are absent from large-scale resources such as ENCODE and GTEx. We explored the relationship between genetic variants influencing predisposition to type 2 diabetes (T2D) and related glycemic traits, and human pancreatic islet transcription using RNA-Seq and genotyping data from 420 islet donors. We find: (a) eQTLs have a variable replication rate across the 44 GTEx tissues ({$<$}73\%), indicating that our study captured islet-specific cis-eQTL signals; (b) islet eQTL signals show marked overlap with islet epigenome annotation, though eQTL effect size is reduced in the stretch enhancers most strongly implicated in GWAS signal location; (c) selective enrichment of islet eQTL overlap with the subset of T2D variants implicated in islet dysfunction; and (d) colocalization between islet eQTLs and variants influencing T2D or related glycemic traits, delivering candidate effector transcripts at 23 loci, including DGKB and TCF7L2. Our findings illustrate the advantages of performing functional and regulatory studies in tissues of greatest disease-relevance while expanding our mechanistic insights into complex traits association loci activity with an expanded list of putative transcripts implicated in T2D development.},

  abstract = {Background: Immunity decreases with age, which leads to reactivation of varicella zoster virus (VZV). In human subjects age-associated immune changes are usually measured in blood leukocytes; however, this might not reflect alterations in tissuespecific immunity. Objectives: We used a VZV antigen challenge system in the skin to investigate changes in tissue-specific mechanisms involved in the decreased response to this virus during aging. Methods: We assessed cutaneous immunity based on the extent of erythema and induration after intradermal VZV antigen injection. We also performed immune histology and transcriptomic analyses on skin biopsy specimens taken from the challenge site in young ({$<$}40 years) and old ({$>$}65 years) subjects. Results: Old human subjects exhibited decreased erythema and induration, CD41 and CD81 T-cell infiltration, and attenuated global gene activation at the site of cutaneous VZV antigen challenge compared with young subjects. This was associated with increased sterile inflammation in the skin in the same subjects related to p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase–related proinflammatory cytokine production (P {$<$} .0007). We inhibited systemic inflammation in old subjects by means of pretreatment with an oral small-molecule p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor (Losmapimod; GlaxoSmithKline, Brentford, United Kingdom), which reduced both serum C-reactive protein levels and peripheral blood monocyte secretion of IL-6 and TNF-a. In contrast, cutaneous responses to VZV antigen challenge were increased significantly in the same subjects (P {$<$} .0003). Conclusion: Excessive inflammation in the skin early after antigen challenge retards antigen-specific immunity. However, this can be reversed by inhibition of inflammatory cytokine production that can be used to promote vaccine efficacy and the treatment of infections and malignancy during aging.

Because pleiotropy was found so frequently, the notion arose that pleiotropy is ‘universal’. However, quantitative estimates of pleiotropy have not been available until recently. These estimates show that pleiotropy is highly restricted and are more in line with the notion of variational modularity than with universal pleiotropy. This finding has major implications for the evolvability of complex organisms and the mapping of disease-causing mutations.},

  abstract = {Heritability, the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genetic factors, can be estimated from pedigree data 1, but such estimates are uninformative with respect to the underlying genetic architecture. Analyses of data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on unrelated individuals have shown that for human traits and disease, approximately one-third to two-thirds of heritability is captured by common SNPs 2-5. It is not known whether the remaining heritability is due to the imperfect tagging of causal variants by common SNPs, in particular if the causal variants are rare, or other reasons such as overestimation of heritability from pedigree data. Here we show that pedigree heritability for height and body mass index (BMI) appears to be fully recovered from whole-genome sequence (WGS) data on 21,620 unrelated individuals of European ancestry. We assigned 47.1 million genetic variants to groups based upon their minor allele frequencies (MAF) and linkage disequilibrium (LD) with variants nearby, and estimated and partitioned variation accordingly. The estimated heritability was 0.79 (SE 0.09) for height and 0.40 (SE 0.09) for BMI, consistent with pedigree estimates. Low-MAF variants in low LD with neighbouring variants were enriched for heritability, to a greater extent for protein altering variants, consistent with negative selection thereon. Cumulatively variants in the MAF range of 0.0001 to 0.1 explained 0.54 (SE 0.05) and 0.51 (SE 0.11) of heritability for height and BMI, respectively. Our results imply that the still missing heritability of complex traits and disease is accounted for by rare variants, in particular those in regions of low LD.},

  abstract = {Horizontal integration of summary statistics from different GWAS traits can be used to evaluate evidence for their shared genetic causality. One popular method to do this is a Bayesian method, coloc, which is attractive in requiring only GWAS summary statistics and no linkage disequilibrium estimates and is now being used routinely to perform thousands of comparisons between traits. Here we show that while most users do not adjust default software values, misspecification of prior parameters can substantially alter posterior inference. We suggest data driven methods to derive sensible prior values, and demonstrate how sensitivity analysis can be used to assess robustness of posterior inference. The flexibility of coloc comes at the expense of an unrealistic assumption of a single causal variant per trait. This assumption can be relaxed by stepwise conditioning, but this requires external software and an LD matrix aligned to study alleles. We have now implemented conditioning within coloc, and propose a new alternative method, masking, that does not require LD and approximates conditioning when causal variants are independent. Importantly, masking can be used in combination with conditioning where allelically aligned LD estimates are available for only a single trait. We have implemented these developments in a new version of coloc which we hope will enable more informed choice of priors and overcome the restriction of the single causal variant assumptions in coloc analysis.},

Our results demonstrate that dosage-sensitive genes have evolved robustness to the disruptive effects of genetic variation by expanding their regulatory domains. This resolves a puzzle in the genetic literature about why disease genes are depleted of cis-eQTLs, suggesting that eQTL information may implicate the wrong genes at genome-wide association study loci, and establishes a framework for identifying non-coding regulatory variation with phenotypic consequences.},

  abstract = {Omics” studies generate long lists of genes, proteins, metabolites or other features which can be difficult to decipher. Feature set enrichment analysis utilizing annotated groups/classes of features (such as pathways, gene ontology terms or gene/metabolic modules) can provide a powerful gateway to associate data to phenotypes such as disease process or treatment progression. At the same time, the increasing use of technologies to generate multidimensional omics data sets based on specific cell types or responses to stimuli increases the number and breadth of annotated feature sets available for enrichment analysis, facilitating the ability to draw biologically relevant conclusions. However, existing tools and applications for enrichment analysis are adapted specifically to gene set enrichment and lack functionalities to analyze rapidly growing amounts of metabolomics and other data. Moreover, such tools often provide only a limited range of statistical methods, rely on permutation tests, lack suitable visualization tools to facilitate result interpretation in complex experimental setups, and lack standalone versions usable in semi-automatized workflows. Here, we present tmod, an R package which implements powerful statistical methods for enrichment analysis. Tmod includes definitions of widely used feature sets for transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling and also allows use of custom user-provided feature sets. Moreover, it provides novel and intuitive visualization methods which facilitate interpretation of complex data sets. The implemented statistical tests allow the significance of enrichment within sorted feature lists to be calculated without randomization tests and thus are suitable for combining functional analysis with multivariate techniques.},

To help overcome this problem, we performed expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) meta-analysis in non-transformed peripheral blood samples from 5,311 individuals with replication in 2,775 individuals. We identified and replicated trans eQTLs for 233 SNPs (reflecting 103 independent loci) that were previously associated with complex traits at genome-wide significance. Some of these SNPs affect multiple genes in trans that are known to be altered in individuals with disease: rs4917014, previously associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), altered gene expression of C1QB and five type I interferon response genes, both hallmarks of SLE. DeepSAGE RNA sequencing showed that rs4917014 strongly alters the 3' UTR levels of IKZF1 in cis, and chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing analysis of the trans-regulated genes implicated IKZF1 as the causal gene. Variants associated with cholesterol metabolism and type 1 diabetes showed similar phenomena, indicating that large-scale eQTL mapping provides insight into the downstream effects of many trait-associated variants.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have shown a large number of genetic variants to be associated with complex diseases. The identification of the causal variant within an associated locus can sometimes be difficult because of the linkage disequilibrium between the associated variants and because most GWAS loci contain multiple genes, or no genes at all. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping is a method used to determine the effects of genetic variants on gene expression levels. eQTL mapping studies have enabled the prioritization of genetic variants within GWAS loci, and have shown that trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) often function in a tissue- or cell type-specific manner, sometimes having downstream effects on completely different chromosomes. Furthermore, recent RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) studies have shown that a large repertoire of transcripts is available in cells, which are actively regulated by (trait-associated) variants. Future eQTL mapping studies will focus on broadening the range of available tissues and cell types, in order to determine the key tissues and cell types involved in complex traits. Finally, large meta-analyses will be able to pinpoint the causal variants within the trait-associated loci and determine their downstream effects in greater detail.

  abstract = {Regulation of gene expression is an important mechanism through which genetic variation can affect complex traits. A substantial portion of gene expression variation can be explained by both local (cis) and distal (trans) genetic variation. Much progress has been made in uncovering cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL), but trans-eQTL have been more difficult to identify and replicate. Here we take advantage of our ability to predict the cis component of gene expression coupled with gene mapping methods such as PrediXcan to identify high confidence candidate trans-acting genes and their targets. That is, we correlate the cis component of gene expression with observed expression of genes in different chromosomes. Leveraging the shared cis-acting regulation across tissues, we combine the evidence of association across all available GTEx tissues and find 2356 trans-acting/target gene pairs with high mappability scores. Reassuringly, trans-acting genes are enriched in transcription and nucleic acid binding pathways and target genes are enriched in known transcription factor binding sites. Interestingly, trans-acting genes are more significantly associated with height than target or background genes, consistent with percolating trans effects. Our scripts and summary statistics are publicly available for future studies of trans-acting gene regulation.},

  abstract = {Influenza is a major cause of respiratory disease leading to hospitalization in young children. However, seasonal trivalent influenza vaccines (TIVs) have been shown to be ineffective and poorly immunogenic in this population. The development of liveattenuated influenza vaccines and adjuvanted vaccines are important advances in the prevention of influenza in young children. The oil-in-water emulsions MF59 and adjuvant systems 03 (AS03) have been used as adjuvants in both seasonal adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccines (ATIVs) and pandemic monovalent influenza vaccines. Compared with non-adjuvanted vaccine responses, these vaccines induce a more robust and persistent antibody response for both homologous and heterologous influenza strains in infants and young children. Evidence of a significant improvement in vaccine efficacy with these adjuvanted vaccines resulted in the use of the monovalent (A/H1N1) AS03-adjuvanted vaccine in children in the 2009 influenza pandemic and the licensure of the seasonal MF59 ATIV for children aged 6 months to 2 years in Canada. The mechanism of action of MF59 and AS03 remains unclear. Adjuvants such as MF59 induce proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including CXCL10, but independently of type-1 interferon. This proinflammatory response is associated with improved recruitment, activation and maturation of antigen presenting cells at the injection site. In young children MF59 ATIV produced more homogenous and robust transcriptional responses, more similar to adult-like patterns, than did TIV. Early gene signatures characteristic of the innate immune response, which correlated with antibody titers were also identified. Differences were detected when comparing child and adult responses including opposite trends in gene set enrichment at day 3 postvaccination and, unlike adult data, a lack of correlation between magnitude of plasmablast response at day 7 and antibody titers at day 28 in children. These insights show the utility of novel approaches in understanding new adjuvants and their importance for developing improved influenza vaccines for children.},

The WHO recommendations are based on data derived from double immunodiffusion reactions involving haemagglutinin and neuraminidase antigens. The revised system of nomenclature is similar to the 1971 system in that it consists of two parts: (a) a type and strain designation, and (b) for influenza A viruses, a description of the antigenic specificity (subtype) of the surface antigens (H and N). The strain designation for influenza virus types A, B, and C contains information on the antigenic type of the virus (based on the antigenic specificity of the nucleoprotein), the host of origin (for strains isolated from non-human sources), geographical origin, strain number, and year of isolation. For influenza A viruses, the antigenic description, in parentheses, follows the strain designation and comprises two indices describing the antigenic subtype of the haemagglutinin and of the neuraminidase antigens. For the influenza A viruses from all species, the H antigens are grouped into 12 subtypes, H1-H12, while the N antigens are divided into 9 subtypes, N1-N9. Reference strains of influenza viruses are maintained by the WHO Collaborating Centres for Reference and Research on Influenza and the WHO Centres for the Study of Influenza Ecology in Animals, and are made available upon request.There is no provision for describing distinct subtypes of influenza B and C viruses. The existence of antigenic variation among influenza B strains is well established but the available information shows that a division into subtypes is not warranted.This revised system of nomenclature should be used universally from the date of publication of this Memorandum.},

  abstract = {Competitive gene set tests are commonly used in molecular pathway analysis to test for enrichment of a particular gene annotation category amongst the differential expression results from a microarray experiment. Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision.

  abstract = {Obesity has become epidemic worldwide, and abdominal obesity has a negative impact on health. Current treatment options on obesity, however, still remain limited. It is then of importance to find a new target for anti-obesity drug development based upon recent molecular studies in obesity. Adenylate cyclase 3 (ADCY3) is the third member of adenylyl cyclase family and catalyses the synthesis of cAMP from ATP. Genetic studies with candidate gene and genome-wide association study approaches have demonstrated that ADCY3 genetic polymorphisms are associated with obesity in European and Chinese populations. Epigenetic studies have indicated that increased DNA methylation levels in the ADCY3 gene are involved in the pathogenesis of obesity. Furthermore, biological analyses with animal models have implicated that ADCY3 dysfunction resulted in increased body weight and fat mass, while reduction of body weight is partially explained by ADCY3 activation. In this review, we describe genomic and biological features of ADCY3, summarize genetic and epigenetic association studies of the ADCY3 gene with obesity and discuss dysfunction and activation of ADCY3. Based upon all data, we suggest that ADCY3 is a new target for anti-obesity drug development. Further investigation on the effectiveness of ADCY3 activator and its delivery approach to treat abdominal obesity has been taken into our consideration.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have deepened our understanding of the genetic architecture of complex traits, the mechanistic links that underlie how genetic variants cause complex traits remains elusive. To advance our understanding of the underlying mechanistic links, various consortia have collected a vast volume of genomic data that enable us to investigate the role that genetic variants play in gene expression regulation. Recently, a collaborative mixed model (CoMM) (Yang et al., 2018a) was proposed to jointly interrogate genome on complex traits by integrating both the GWAS dataset and the expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) dataset. Although CoMM is a powerful approach that leverages regulatory information while accounting for the uncertainty in using an eQTL dataset, it requires individual-level GWAS data and cannot fully make use of widely available GWAS summary statistics. Therefore, statistically efficient methods that leverages transcriptome information using only summary statistics information from GWAS data are required. Results: In this study, we propose a novel probabilistic model, CoMM-S2, to examine the mechanistic role that genetic variants play, by using only GWAS summary statistics instead of individual-level GWAS data. Similar to CoMM which uses individual-level GWAS data, CoMM-S2 combines two models: the first model examines the relationship between gene expression and genotype, while the second model examines the relationship between the phenotype and the predicted gene expression from the first model. Distinct from CoMM, CoMM-S2 requires only GWAS summary statistics. Using both simulation studies and real data analysis, we demonstrate that even though CoMM-S2 utilizes GWAS summary statistics, it has comparable performance as CoMM, which uses individual-level GWAS data.

  abstract = {Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature, yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned—that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here I argue that most inferential statistical tests in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. I demonstrate how foundational assumptions of the "random effects" model used pervasively in psychology impose far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints dramatically inflates false positive rates and routinely leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack any meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that failure to consider generalizability from a statistical perspective lies at the root of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.},

  abstract = {While the impact of common genetic variants on gene expression response to cellular stimuli has been analyzed in depth, less is known about how stimulation modulates the genetic control of isoform usage. Analyzing RNA-seq profiles of monocyte-derived dendritic cells from 243 individuals, we uncovered thousands of unannotated isoforms synthesized in response to viral infection and stimulation with type I interferon. We identified more than a thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with isoform usage (isoQTLs), \&gt; 40\% of which are independent of expression QTLs for the same gene. Compared to eQTLs, isoQTLs are enriched for splice sites and untranslated regions, and depleted of sequences upstream of annotated transcription start sites. Both eQTLs and isoQTLs in stimulated cells explain a significant proportion of the disease heritability attributed to common genetic variants. At the IRF7 locus, we found alternative promoter usage in response to influenza as a possible mechanism by which DNA variants previously associated with immune-related disorders mediate disease risk. At the ERAP2 locus, we shed light on the function of the major haplotype that has been maintained under long-term balancing selection. At baseline and following type 1 interferon stimulation, the major haplotype is associated with absence of ERAP2 expression while the minor haplotype, known to increase Crohn's disease risk, is associated with high ERAP2 expression. Surprisingly, in response to influenza infection, the major haplotype results in the expression of two uncharacterized, alternatively transcribed, spliced and translated short isoforms. Thus, genetic variants at a single locus could modulate independent gene regulatory processes in the innate immune response, and in the case of ERAP2, may confer a historical fitness advantage in response to virus.},

Using ATAC-seq from 95 individuals in this hIPSC model we fine-map candidate causal variants at risk loci for Alzheimer’s disease, the most prevalent neurodegenerative condition in acute brain injury patients.

  abstract = {The pathogens causing AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis have proven too complex to be overcome by classical approaches to vaccination. The complexities of human immunology and pathogen-induced modulation of the immune system mandate new approaches to vaccine discovery and design. A new field, systems vaccinology, weds holistic analysis of innate and adaptive immunity within a quantitative framework to enable rational design of new vaccines that elicit tailored protective immune responses. A key step in the approach is to discover relationships between the earliest innate inflammatory responses to vaccination and the subsequent vaccine-induced adaptive immune responses and efficacy. Analysis of these responses in clinical studies is complicated by the inaccessibility of relevant tissue compartments (such as the lymph node), necessitating reliance upon peripheral blood responses as surrogates. Blood transcriptomes, although indirect to vaccine mechanisms, have proven very informative in systems vaccinology studies. The approach is most powerful when innate and adaptive immune responses are integrated with vaccine efficacy, which is possible for malaria with the advent of a robust human challenge model. This is more difficult for AIDS and tuberculosis, given that human challenge models are lacking and efficacy observed in clinical trials has been low or highly variable. This challenge can be met by appropriate clinical trial design for partially efficacious vaccines and by analysis of natural infection cohorts. Ultimately, systems vaccinology is an iterative approach in which mechanistic hypotheses-derived from analysis of clinical studies-are evaluated in model systems, and then used to guide the development of new vaccine strategies. In this review, we will illustrate the above facets of the systems vaccinology approach with case studies.},

  abstract = {There is increasing appreciation that the immune system plays critical roles not only in the traditional domains of infection and inflammation but also in many areas of biology, including tumorigenesis, metabolism, and even neurobiology. However, one of the major barriers for understanding human immunological mechanisms is that immune assays have not been reproducibly characterized for a sufficiently large and diverse healthy human cohort. Here, we present the 10,000 Immunomes Project (10KIP), a framework for growing a diverse human immunology reference, from ImmPort, a publicly available resource of subject-level immunology data. Although some measurement types are sparse in the presently deposited ImmPort database, the extant data allow for a diversity of robust comparisons. Using 10KIP, we describe variations in serum cytokines and leukocytes by age, race, and sex; define a baseline cell-cytokine network; and describe immunologic changes in pregnancy. All data in the resource are available for visualization and download at http:// 10kimmunomes.org/.},

  abstract = {Expression QTL (eQTL) detection has emerged as an important tool for unraveling the relationship between genetic risk factors and disease or clinical phenotypes. Most studies are predicated on the assumption that only a single causal variant explains the association signal in each interval. This greatly simplifies the statistical modeling, but is liable to biases in scenarios where multiple local causal-variants are responsible. Here, our primary goal was to address the prevalence of secondary cis-eQTL signals regulating peripheral blood gene expression locally, utilizing two large human cohort studies, each .2500 samples with accompanying whole genome genotypes. The CAGE (Consortium for the Architecture of Gene Expression) dataset is a compendium of Illumina microarray studies, and the Framingham Heart Study is a two-generation Affymetrix dataset. We also describe Bayesian colocalization analysis of the extent of sharing of cis-eQTL detected in both studies as well as with the BIOS RNAseq dataset. Stepwise conditional modeling demonstrates that multiple eQTL signals are present for  40\% of over 3500 eGenes in both microarray datasets, and that the number of loci with additional signals reduces by approximately two-thirds with each conditioning step. Although ,20\% of the peak signals across platforms fine map to the same credible interval, the colocalization analysis finds that as many as 50–60\% of the primary eQTL are actually shared. Subsequently, colocalization of eQTL signals with GWAS hits detected 1349 genes whose expression in peripheral blood is associated with 591 human phenotype traits or diseases, including enrichment for genes with regulatory functions. At least 10\%, and possibly as many as 40\%, of eQTL-trait colocalized signals are due to nonprimary cis-eQTL peaks, but just one-quarter of these colocalization signals replicated across the gene expression datasets. Our results are provided as a web-based resource for visualization of multi-site regulation of gene expression and its association with human complex traits and disease states.},

  abstract = {Background: Combining genomic data sets from multiple studies is advantageous to increase statistical power in studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or require the sequential generation of data. However, significant technical heterogeneity is commonly observed across multiple batches of data that are generated from different processing or reagent batches, experimenters, protocols, or profiling platforms. These so-called batch effects often confound true biological relationships in the data, reducing the power benefits of combining multiple batches, and may even lead to spurious results in some combined studies. Therefore there is significant need for effective methods and software tools that account for batch effects in high-throughput genomic studies. Results: Here we contribute multiple methods and software tools for improved combination and analysis of data from multiple batches. In particular, we provide batch effect solutions for cases where the severity of the batch effects is not extreme, and for cases where one high-quality batch can serve as a reference, such as the training set in a biomarker study. We illustrate our approaches and software in both simulated and real data scenarios. Conclusions: We demonstrate the value of these new contributions compared to currently established approaches in the specified batch correction situations.},

  abstract = {The protective mechanisms of influenza vaccines in young children are not completely understood. A phase 2 clinical study was conducted in 85 children 12-35 months of age to describe and compare the immune responses to live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) with trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV). To better understand the biology of vaccine effects, oligonucleotide microarrays were employed to measure the genome-wide changes in transcript profiles in whole blood at approximately 7 days after 1 dose of LAIV or TIV. Of the total 265 differentially expressed genes identified in this study, 6 clusters of genes were identified to be tightly coexpressed, many of which are likely modulated by cytokines including type 1 interferons (IFNs) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Additional functional analyses revealed that the type 1 IFN pathway and cell cycle regulation-related genes are enriched in the 6 coexpressed gene sets. Promoter characterization of these coexpressed genes also supported this conclusion. Moreover, it is suggested that the IFN-stimulated response element is likely to be a potential bidirectional promoter, and the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein might cooperate with the E2F transcription factor family in the regulation of the cell cycle in the early immune response induced by the influenza vaccine. Overall, our study clearly indicates that the expression profile changes induced by LAIV are significantly different from those induced by TIV. These results suggest that the pattern of overexpression of type 1 IFN-stimulated genes can potentially be used as a biomarker to identify the early vaccination response of LAIV and may also explain, to a certain extent, previous clinical study observations of LAIV-induced protection against influenza-like illness in the first 2 weeks after administration. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {Background: There exist many methods for describing the complex relation between changes of gene expression in molecular pathways or gene ontologies under different experimental conditions. Among them, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis seems to be one of the most commonly used (over 10,000 citations). An important parameter, which could affect the final result, is the choice of a metric for the ranking of genes. Applying a default ranking metric may lead to poor results. Methods and results: In this work 28 benchmark data sets were used to evaluate the sensitivity and false positive rate of gene set analysis for 16 different ranking metrics including new proposals. Furthermore, the robustness of the chosen methods to sample size was tested. Using k-means clustering algorithm a group of four metrics with the highest performance in terms of overall sensitivity, overall false positive rate and computational load was established i.e. absolute value of Moderated Welch Test statistic, Minimum Significant Difference, absolute value of Signal-To-Noise ratio and Baumgartner-Weiss-Schindler test statistic. In case of false positive rate estimation, all selected ranking metrics were robust with respect to sample size. In case of sensitivity, the absolute value of Moderated Welch Test statistic and absolute value of Signal-To-Noise ratio gave stable results, while Baumgartner-Weiss-Schindler and Minimum Significant Difference showed better results for larger sample size. Finally, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis method with all tested ranking metrics was parallelised and implemented in MATLAB, and is available at https://github.com/ZAEDPolSl/MrGSEA. Conclusions: Choosing a ranking metric in Gene Set Enrichment Analysis has critical impact on results of pathway enrichment analysis. The absolute value of Moderated Welch Test has the best overall sensitivity and Minimum Significant Difference has the best overall specificity of gene set analysis. When the number of non-normally distributed genes is high, using Baumgartner-Weiss-Schindler test statistic gives better outcomes. Also, it finds more enriched pathways than other tested metrics, which may induce new biological discoveries.},
