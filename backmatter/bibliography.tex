% Bibliography

% heading=bibintoc
% This is is the default heading used by \printbibliography if the heading op-
% tion is not given. Its default definition depends on the document class. If the
% class provides a \chapter command, the heading is similar to the bibliography
% heading of the standard LaTeX book class, i. e., it uses \chapter* to create
% an unnumbered chapter heading which is not included in the table of
% contents.
%
% heading=bibintoc
% Similar to bibliography above but adds an entry to the table of contents.
\printbibliography[
    heading=bibintoc,
    title={Bibliography}
]
