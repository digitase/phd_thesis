% Use the context-content-conclusion (C-C-C) scheme
%
% The beginning sets up the context for the story, while the body (content)
% advances the story towards an ending in which the problems find their
% conclusions. This structure reduces the chance that the reader will wonder "Why
% was I told that?" (if the context is missing) or "So what?" (if the conclusion
% is missing).
