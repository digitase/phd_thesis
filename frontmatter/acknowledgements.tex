\chapter{Acknowledgements}

\enquote{The more you know, the more you know you don't know}.
No other aphorism may be more apt to describe my perspective on these past four years,
but what I do know---without a doubt---is that I owe a great deal to a great many people.

First and foremost, I must thank my supervisor, Carl Anderson.
I greatly admire your commitment to embodying a culture of rigorous first-class science,
and equally your commitment to the prosperity and well-being of everyone under your wing. 
I am indebted for all of your patient support and guidance, 
and your empathy and optimism during interesting times.
Thank you for the privilege of the past four years---it has been an honour and a pleasure.

I must also take the opportunity to address the members of the Anderson team, past and present.
% iterate through team members past and present
The team has greatly evolved these past few years both in scientific direction and in membership,
but it always remained a friendly and enriching place to be. 
Whether over the lunch table in Murrays,
during our legendary team retreats,
or in our traditionally lively team meetings,
there was no lack of supportive and productive discussion.
In particular, I must thank
    Aleksejs Sazonovs,
    Carla Jones-Bell,
    Elizabeth Goode,
    Laura Fachal,
    Leland Taylor,
    Loukas Moutsians, 
    Nikos Panoussis,
    and Velislava Petrova,
    each of whom I consulted many times,
    and was never met with complaints. 

The research presented in this thesis could not have been possible without the help of numerous individuals and organisations.
The projects in this thesis are highly collaborative, extending from Sanger to London, Exeter, and the US.
To Prof Adrian Hayday, Dr Nicholas Kennedy, and Dr Tariq Ahmad, thank you for granting me the opportunity to be part of these amazing collaborations.
I owe a sincere gratitude to many clinicians, scientists and administrators who laid the foundation for this thesis,
and especially to the patients who contributed their samples.
I would also like to thank the Wellcome Trust and the other funding agencies that contributed to the projects in my thesis for their generous financial support.

Thank you to my thesis committee, Dr Daniel Gaffney and Dr Michael Inouye, who provided valuable feedback throughout the course of my PhD.
I also extend my gratitude to the amazing research administrators I've worked with, Carol Dunbar, Sally Bygraves, Eloise Stapleton, Paris Litterick, Rachel Henry, and Sophie Leggett.
I'm sure there's been times you've all known more about my thesis than me. 
% Without you all my research would have struggled to stay afloat.
To the Sanger Sample Management, Pipelines and Informatics teams,
the work you do to keep the sequencing and computing resources running smoothly was critical for this thesis, and for all science done on the Campus.

On the other side of the balance, I would like thank all the friends I have made during my time in Cambridge.
To my fellow PhD cohort, 
I'll remember all the punting trips, the pub quizzes, the eSCAMPS dinners,
and our shared commiserations about the Campus Bus.
To the Churchill College badminton team, thank you for having me. I'm sure you'll have many more years at the top of the league to come.
I would like to give a special mention to my friends from the Cambridge University Anime and Manga Society.
Many good times were had, many good memories were made.
You've all made my \enquote{campus life} very much multicoloured.

Finally, to my family.
To my brother, my mother, my father, my grandparents:
I could always depend on your unconditional love and support.
Despite the thousands of miles between us, 
all of you were always held close to my heart.
