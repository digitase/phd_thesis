No other aphorism may be more apt to describe my perspective on these past four years,

Supervisors
Research group and lab assistants
Research participants
Funding bodies/sponsorship providers

1st class scientific rigor, embedded in lab culture

empathy* and positivity in the more interesting times,

Here I must also take the opportunity to thank the members of the Anderson team, past and present.
