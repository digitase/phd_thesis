% all other non-breaking changes increment the patch number (lowest risk).

\frontmatter

% \include{filename} essentially does a \clearpage before and after
% \input{filename}, [...] is primarily useful when you have a big project on a slow
% computer; changing one of the include targets won't force you to regenerate the
% outputs of all the rest. [...] but it also can't be nested, can't
% appear in the preamble, and forces page breaks around the included text.
