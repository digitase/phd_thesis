\frontmatter
%
% \include{filename} essentially does a \clearpage before and after
% \input{filename}, [...] is primarily useful when you have a big project on a slow
% computer; changing one of the include targets won't force you to regenerate the
% outputs of all the rest. [...] but it also can't be nested, can't
% appear in the preamble, and forces page breaks around the included text.
%
%    The \clearpage command ends the current page and causes all figures and
%    tables that have so far appeared in the input to be printed.
