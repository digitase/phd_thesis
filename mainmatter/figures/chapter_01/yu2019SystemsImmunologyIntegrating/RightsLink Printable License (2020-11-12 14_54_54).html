Preprints should not be added to or enhanced in any way in order to appear more like, or to substitute for, the final versions of articles however authors can update their preprints on arXiv or RePEc with their Accepted Author Manuscript (see below).<p>If accepted for publication, we encourage authors to link from the preprint to their formal publication via its DOI. Millions of researchers have access to the formal publications on ScienceDirect, and so links will help users to find, access, cite and use the best available version. Please note that Cell Press, The Lancet and some society-owned have different preprint policies. Information on these policies is available on the journal homepage.<p><strong>Accepted Author Manuscripts:</strong> An accepted author manuscript is the manuscript of an article that has been accepted for publication and which typically includes author-incorporated changes suggested during submission, peer review and editor-author communications.<p>Authors can share their accepted author manuscript:<ul><li>immediately<ul><li>via their non-commercial person homepage or blog<li>by updating a preprint in arXiv or RePEc with the accepted manuscript<li>via their research institute or institutional repository for internal institutional uses or as part of an invitation-only research collaboration work-group<li>directly by providing copies to their students or to research collaborators for their personal use<li>for private scholarly sharing as part of an invitation-only work group on commercial sites with which Elsevier has an agreement</ul><li>After the embargo period<ul><li>via non-commercial hosting platforms such as their institutional repository<li>via commercial sites with which Elsevier has an agreement</ul></ul><p>In all cases accepted manuscripts should:<ul><li>link to the formal publication via its DOI<li>bear a CC-BY-NC-ND license - this is easy to do<li>if aggregated with other manuscripts, for example in a repository or other site, be shared in alignment with our hosting policy not be added to or enhanced in any way to appear more like, or to substitute for, the published journal article.</ul><p><strong>Published journal article (JPA):</strong> A published journal article (PJA) is the definitive final record of published research that appears or will appear in the journal and embodies all value-adding publishing activities including peer review co-ordination, copy-editing, formatting, (if relevant) pagination and online enrichment.<p>Policies for sharing publishing journal articles differ for subscription and gold open access articles:<p><strong><u>Subscription Articles:</u></strong> If you are an author, please share a link to your article rather than the full-text.

This includes use for classroom teaching and internal training at the institution (including use in course packs and courseware programs), and inclusion of the article for grant funding purposes.<p><strong><u>Gold Open Access Articles:</u></strong> May be shared according to the author-selected end-user license and should contain a <a href=http://www.crossref.org/crossmark/index.html title=blocked::http://www.crossref.org/crossmark/index.html target=_blank>CrossMark logo</a>, the end user license, and a DOI link to the formal publication on ScienceDirect.<p>Please refer to Elsevier's <a href=http://www.elsevier.com/about/open-access/open-access-policies/article-posting-policy title=blocked::http://www.elsevier.com/about/open-access/open-access-policies/article-posting-policy target=_blank>posting policy</a> for further information.<p>18.<strong> For book authors </strong><strong><span style=font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold>the following clauses are applicable in addition to the above:</span> </strong>&nbsp; Authors are permitted to place a brief summary of their work online only<span class=GramE>.</span> You are not allowed to download and post the published electronic version of your chapter, nor may you scan the printed edition to create an electronic version. <b style=mso-bidi-font-weight:normal>Posting to a repository: </b>Authors are permitted to post a summary of their chapter only in their institution's repository.<b style=mso-bidi-font-weight:normal><o:p></o:p></b><p>19.<strong> Thesis/Dissertation</strong>: If your license is for use in a thesis/dissertation your thesis may be submitted to your institution in either print or electronic form.
