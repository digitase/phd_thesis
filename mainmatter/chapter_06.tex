Limitations, and the perfect study.

A response eqtl is not always a response eqtl

Era of single cell.

Cost-effectiveness and clinical implementation

Deep phenotyping
    
    disease specific biobanks e.g. ibd bioresource/predicct

unification
    immunology and vaccine dev: deep phenotyping, small cohorts achieved -> larger cohorts
    human genetics and gwas: large cohorts achieved -> deeper phenotyping
