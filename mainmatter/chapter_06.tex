\chapter{Discussion}

Tie ch 2 to 3 using baseline predictors?

Limitations, and the perfect study.

A response eqtl is not always a response eqtl

More timepoints
Allele-specific expression changes dynamically during T cell activation in HLA and other autoimmune loci

More conditions
e.g. 250
e.g. StructLMM 
    Identifies eQTLs with GxE, where the number of environments in E is large (modelled as a random effect)

as datasets and conditions get larger, proportion of eGenes is going to be 100pc, then the question is what are the most relevant ones

Era of single cell.

    current sc will only detect highly expressed genes

Cost-effectiveness and clinical implementation

    if you can identify NRs, what are you going to do about it?

Deep phenotyping
    
    disease specific biobanks e.g. ibd bioresource/predicct

unification
    immunology and vaccine dev: deep phenotyping, small cohorts achieved -> larger cohorts
    human genetics and gwas: large cohorts achieved -> deeper phenotyping
