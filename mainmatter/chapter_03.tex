\chapter{Genetic contribution to Pandemrix vaccine response}

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{<Context-specific QTLs>}

Review of in vitro stimulation condition QTL mapping.

Review of in vivo mapping.

\subsection{Mapping quantitative trait loci}

Simple, mixed models, joint models, multilocus models; Ending with why we chose mashr

for discussion of how lmm implementation doesn't matter (Eu-ahsunthornwattana et al., 2014)

Can refer to previous notes in "2017\_Book\_SystemsGenetics"

mashr beats out stuff it compared to in the paper e.g. metasoft

\subsection{Colocalization}

% What is coloc and why coloc

% See coloc_comparisons in notes for a summary

Due to the increasingly abundant

For example, ran 

Coloc and assumptions

Hypercoloc and assumptions

large numbers of traits

Confounding by multiple causal

Fine mapping
