Causal anchors.
Leveraging natural variation.

\section{A brief history of complex trait genetics}

Mendellian genetics, family and linkage studies

Common variation, X years of GWAS
Candidate gene studies (Border et al., 2019)
Missing heritability

Rare variation, burden tests

Locus to gene problem, nc variation.
Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified genetic variants associated with immune-mediated disease, the majority of which are non-coding[10 Years of GWAS Discovery].

Under the assumption that the mechanism by which non-coding associations affect disease risk is through their effect on gene expression, a successful way to link associations to their target gene is by statistical colocalisation with eQTL datasets, to determine if the GWAS and eQTL signal share the same causal variant[Co-localization of Conditional eQTL and GWAS Signatures in Schizophrenia].

Factors affecting the healthy immune system.

\subsection{Genetic factors affecting immune response to challenge}

Given the genetic control of the healthy immune system, one can hypothesise that immune response to challenge may also be influenced by genetic factors.

\section{Vaccines for controlled immune challenge}

One issue is controlling perturbation.

\subsection{Empirical to systems vaccinology}

Vaccines have enormous impact on global health and quality of life, but the immunological mechanisms that underpin a specific vaccineâ€™s success or failure in a given individual are often poorly understood[Immunological mechanisms of vaccination]. 

Omics technologies are increasingly employed to model the factors that cause variation in individual vaccination outcome on a systems level. 
These systems vaccinology studies often consider longitudinal measurements of the transcriptomic, cellular, cytokine, and antibody immune responses following vaccination[Vaccinology in the era of high-throughput biology.].

Relatively few studies have assessed the impact of human genetic variation on responses[Franco, Lareau 2016].

This is despite evidence from genome-wide association studies suggesting such genetic variation influences immune response to vaccines and susceptibility to disease[Systems immunogenetics of vaccines.].
