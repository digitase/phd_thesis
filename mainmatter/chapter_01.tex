\chapter{Introduction}

\section{The framework of human genetics}

Systems biology:

Linkage, GWAS (10 years), burden tests

Candidate genes (Border et al., 2019)

molecular QTLs

coloc, fine mapping

TWAS, PheWAS\autocite{vermaCurrentScopeChallenges2017}, MR

pathway analysis

\section{Host factors affecting vaccine response}

Overview, including pathogen-side factors

Review of systems vaccinology

How to use sysvacc to inform better design \autocite{Mooney2013a}, and how to move towards personalised vaccinology (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.07.062).

\section{The genetics of vaccine response}

General genetics of immune response, including disease e.g. Immune Response Mainly Heritable? 

Genetics of adverse events e.g. \url{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18454680}

Results from vaccine-related twin studies e.g. in "TWIN STUDIES ON GENETIC VARIATIONS IN RESISTANCE TO TUBERCULOSIS", and \autocite{Qi2016} 

Review paper on GWAS for vaccines \autocite{Mooney2013}

\section{Thesis overview}

By chapter overview of knowns and unknowns
