\subsection{The advent of \glsfmtshort{GWAS}}

Common disease, common variant

X years of GWAS

Missing heritability

comparison: array - WES - WGS

WES (about 40Mbp)
        go rarer variation vs WGS
            due to better coverage in just the exons

        but lower n,
            so lower power than array genotyping to do single variant associations

    WGS

        structural variants

        rare variants
            uncovered by arrays
            generally higher effect size
            often exonic

            burden tests (e.g. SAIGE)
                aggregate based on variant consequence scores e.g. vep scores
                to get gene

\subsection{Post-\glsfmtshort{GWAS}: narrowing the signal}

PheWAS\autocite{verma2017CurrentScopeChallenges}

Fine-mapping

    as sample sizes get larger, and provided that sequencing or imputation can
    more exhaustively identify all of the candidate SNPs on the haplotype, rare
    recombination events will pile up, helping to make the causal SNP stand out
    above the passenger SNPs that usually travel on its haplotype [Huang 2017].

    tag snps
    causal snps may not be directly typed, may need to be imputed

\subsection{Post-\glsfmtshort{GWAS}: interpretation of genetic associations with molecular studies}

Locus to gene mapping problem
    nc snps
        Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified genetic variants associated with immune-mediated disease, the majority of which are non-coding[10 Years of GWAS Discovery].

Why care?
    Understand mech. of causal genes

    Drug target prioritisation for disease traits

    how to drug a complex disease with no single 'candidate gene'?

        e.g. of successful GWAS -> drug target
            drug targets with genetic support are more likely

    coloc
        Under the assumption that the mechanism by which non-coding associations affect disease risk is through their effect on gene expression, a successful way to link associations to their target gene is by statistical colocalisation with eQTL datasets, to determine if the GWAS and eQTL signal share the same causal variant[Co-localization of Conditional eQTL and GWAS Signatures in Schizophrenia].

    TWAS
    % When a TWAS gene also colocalizes with your trait of interest you have a 19% chance you've found the correct causal gene.

        % Another solution is functional genomics — you ask whether the GWAS hit SNPs are also known, from other datasets, to have functional effects on a gene. See, as one example, a recent study of drug targets for immune-related traits [Fang 2019].

\section{Context is key}

for both gwas, and molQTLs, context is key

Factors affecting the healthy immune system.

\subsection{Genetic factors affecting immune response to challenge}

Given the genetic control of the healthy immune system, one can hypothesise that immune response to challenge may also be influenced by genetic factors.

The need for controlled immune challenge in trials.
Studies of natural infection are complicated.
clinical trials as an opportunity: 
    Vaccines and drugs used as controlled immune challenge.

\section{Immune response to vaccination}

Vaccination has enormous impact on global health [10.1098/rstb.2013.0433].

Vaccines stimulate the immune system with pathogen-derived antigens to induce effector responses (primarily antigen-specific antibodies) and immunological memory against the pathogen itself.
These effector responses are then be rapidly reactivated in cases of future exposure to the pathogen, mediating long-term protection.

However, a vaccine that is highly efficacious in one human population may have significantly lower efficacy in other populations.

% Vaccination of special populations: Protecting the vulnerable.
Particularly challenging populations for vaccination include the infants and elderly, pregnant, immuno comprimised patients, ethnically-diverse populations, and developing countries.
For the majority of licensed vaccines, there is a lack of understanding regarding the molecular mechanisms that underpin this variation in host immune response.
Immunological mechanisms that underpin a specific vaccine's success or failure in a given individual are often poorly understood[Immunological mechanisms of vaccination].

Systems vaccinology is the application of -omics technologies to provide a systems-level characterisation of the human immune system after vaccine-perturbation.
Measurements are taken at multiple molecular levels (e.g. genome, transcriptome, proteome), and molecular signatures that correlate with and predict vaccine-induced immunity are identified [http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2014.0146].
Systems vaccinology has been successfully applied to a variety of licensed vaccines [yellow fever, influenza], and also to vaccine candidates against [HIV, malaria], resulting in the identification of early transcriptomic signatures that predict vaccine-induced antibody responses.

How to use sysvacc to inform better design (A systems framework for vaccine design Mooney2013), and how to move towards personalised vaccinology (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.07.062).

Overview, including pathogen-side factors

\subsection{Genetics factors affecting vaccine response}

Relatively few studies have assessed the impact of human genetic variation on responses[Franco, Lareau 2016].

This is despite evidence from genome-wide association studies suggesting such genetic variation influences immune response to vaccines and susceptibility to disease[Systems immunogenetics of vaccines.].
