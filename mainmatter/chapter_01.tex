\section{Structure and diversity of the human genome}

\1 The human genome is almost three billion \glspl{bp} in length, containing 20000-25000 protein-coding genes \autocite{1000genomesprojectconsortium2015GlobalReferenceHuman,theencodeprojectconsortium2012IntegratedEncyclopediaDNA} that span 1-3\% of its length.
The majority of the remainder is likely dedicated to regulatory activities \autocite{theencodeprojectconsortium2012IntegratedEncyclopediaDNA}.
A diploid human cell contains two copies of the genome; 46 chromosomes comprised of 23 maternal-parental pairs: 22 pairs of homologous autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes.
%
\1 Variation in the genome between individuals in a population exists in the form of \glspl{SNP}, short indels, and structural variants---\glspl{SNP} and short indels take up the vast majority ($> \percentage{99.9}$) \autocite{1000genomesprojectconsortium2015GlobalReferenceHuman}.
% https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbvar/content/overview/
% Structural variation (SV) is generally defined as a region of DNA
% approximately 1 kb and larger in size and can include inversions and
% balanced translocations or genomic imbalances (insertions and deletions),
% commonly referred to as copy number variants (CNVs).
On average, a pair of human genomes differs by one \gls{SNP} per 1000-2000 \gls{bp} \autocite{theinternationalsnpmapworkinggroup2001MapHumanGenome}.
Each version of a variant is called an allele; an individual has a maternal and parental allele at each variant.

% The Law of Dominance: An organism with alternate forms of a gene will express the form that is dominant.
% Law of Segregation: states that a diploid organism passes a randomly selected allele for a trait to its offspring, such that the offspring receives one allele from each parent.
% Law of independent assortment: states that genes do not influence each other with regard to the sorting of alleles into gametes; every possible combination of alleles for every gene is equally likely to occur.
\1 The many variants in a population are inherited in a smaller number of haplotypes: 
contiguous stretches of the genome passed through generations via meiotic segregation.
The fundamental sources of genetic diversity are mutation and meiotic recombination, generating new alleles and breaking apart haplotypes into shorter ones over time.
\todo{LD decay just takes a really really long time, but there are evo forces at work too that maintain LD}
Variants at physically close positions (loci) on a chromosome are less likely to flank a recombination event, hence more likely to cosegregate on the same haplotype, referred to as genetic linkage.
Genetic linkage is one source of \gls{LD}: the non-random association of alleles at two loci, differing from expectation based on their frequencies and the law of independent assortment \autocite{slatkin2008LinkageDisequilibriumUnderstanding}.
\gls{LD} is often quantified within a population by $r^2$, the squared correlation coefficient between alleles \autocite{slatkin2008LinkageDisequilibriumUnderstanding}.

Recombination events are not distributed uniformly throughout the genome.
The genome is a mosaic of blocks delimited by recombination hotspots, 
characterised by strong \gls{LD} within blocks, and little \gls{LD} between blocks \autocite{wall2003HaplotypeBlocksLinkage,theinternationalhapmapconsortium2007SecondGenerationHuman}.
The structure of correlated haplotypes reflects a population's unique evolutionary history, and can be used to trace the demography of human populations back through time \autocite{karczewski2020AnalyticTranslationalGenetics}.

\section{Genetic association studies for complex traits}

\1 Variation in human traits arises from an interplay between genetics and environment.
Traits for which genetic variation explains a non-zero fraction of phenotypic variation are heritable.
    \2 Twin studies provide upper bounds on heritability \url{https://www.nature.com/articles/nrg3243}
\1 Discovering the specific variants that contribute, through association of genetic variants and phenotypes measured from the same individual, is a mainstay of the field of human genetics.
Barring somatic mutation, an individual's genome is fixed at conception, providing a causally upstream anchor.
Genetic association studies have intrinsic resistance to backdoor path effects that permeate observational studies of the causes of human phenotypes.

    % In humans, analysis of large-scale natural variation data can provide valuable insights into human
    % disease and gene function. Joint analysis of genotype and phenotype data is especially powerful,
    % but even in the absence of phenotype data, patterns of variation data across the genome can inform
    % population history, natural selection, and the biological function of genes.
    \2 What are the benefits of leveraging natural genetic variation? Analogies to RCTs.

\1 Under the central dogma, information flows from gene to RNA to protein to phenotype via transcription and translation, thus it is assumed that genetic variants at loci in the genome affect phenotype through by impacting on the function or regulation of target genes.
How genetic variation contributes to any heritable trait defines it's genetic architecture: the number of genes affecting that trait; and the allele frequencies, effect sizes, and interactions of trait-associated variants \autocite{visscher2019Fisher1918Paper}.
The number of genes defines a spectrum of traits from monogenic (where inheritance follow simple Mendelian patterns) to polygenic (where inheritance is more complex).
Many architectures have been proposed for complex traits; all have in common that the number of genes that affect a complex trait is large (ranging from dozens to many thousands),
and the average effect of trait-associated loci is relatively small compared to monogenic traits \autocite{gibson2011RareCommonVariants,boyle2017ExpandedViewComplex}.

\1 For decades, linkage analysis was successfully used to map loci affecting Mendelian traits by tracing their cosegregation with the trait through pedigrees.
They were not successful for complex traits, as small effect sizes equate to low penetrance in pedigrees \autocite{visscher2012FiveYearsGWAS}.
Genetic association studies were also performed for a variety of traits, focusing on variants in or near candidate genes selected on the basis of prior biological knowledge,
but these studies were plagued with reproducibility issues \autocite{hirschhorn2002ComprehensiveReviewGenetic}.

\1 \Glspl{GWAS} systematically test common variants (traditionally defined as $\text{\gls{MAF}} > 1-5\%$) selected in an unbiased manner across the genome for association with a trait.
Many of the early association studies were on traits now known to be complex.

\subsection{From trait to locus: principles of \glsfmtlongpl{GWAS}}

As variants on the same haplotype tend to be in strong \gls{LD}, and the number of haplotypes is comparatively few, 
it is possible to select a subset of tag variants such that all other known common variants are within a certain \gls{LD} threshold of that subset. 
In practice, there is enough redundancy that the number of variants measured on a modern genotyping array (in the order of \numrange[retain-unity-mantissa=false]{1e5}{1e6}) is sufficient to tag almost all common variants  \autocite{theinternationalhapmapconsortium2005HaplotypeMapHuman,barrett2006EvaluatingCoverageGenomewide}.
Remaining common variants are indirectly measured through their strong correlation with a tag variant.
Furthermore, as unrelated individuals still share short ancestral haplotypes, 
study samples can be assigned haplotypes from a panel of haplotypes derived from reference samples by matching on the directly genotyped variants.
This process of genotype imputation allows ascertainment of variants not directly genotyped \autocite{das2018GenotypeImputationLarge},
and help to recover many rarer variants that are poorly-tagged \autocite{visscher201710YearsGWAS}.
\todo{seems like there is some connection to be made between the tagability of common variation and the feasibility of imputation}
Modern imputation panels enable cost-effective \glspl{GWAS} including tens of millions of variants down to frequencies of \textapprox{0.01\%} \url{https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/563866v1}.

Testing such large numbers of variants incurs a massive multiple testing burden, but acknowledging the correlation between variants due to \gls{LD},
there are only the equivalent of \textapprox{10^6} independent tests in the European genome, regardless of the number of tests actually performed \autocite{peer2008EstimationMultipleTesting}.
The field has thus converged on a fixed discovery threshold of $0.05 / 10^6 = \num{5e-8}$ for genome-wide significance in European populations \autocite{jannot2015108HasEmerged}, akin\footnote{
    The Bonferroni procedure makes no assumptions about the dependence structure of the \pvalues, and is conservative (i.e. controls the \gls{FWER} at a stricter level than the chosen $\alpha$) even for independent tests. In fact it is always conservative unless the \pvalues have strong negative correlations \autocite{goeman2014MultipleHypothesisTesting}.
}
to controlling the family-wise type I error rate at using the Bonferroni correction.
Still, for complex traits with small per-variant effects, the required sample sizes are enormous \autocite{visscher201710YearsGWAS}.
Total \gls{GWAS} sample sizes in the millions are no longer an unusual occurrence \autocite{tam2019BenefitsLimitationsGenomewide}.

\todo{CUT: There is a limit, the strategy of association is fundamentally unsuited to rare variants.}
%     Rare Variants Association Analysis in Large-Scale Sequencing Studies at the Single Locus Level
%     https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004993
%     Despite being extremely successful for common variants in GWA studies [43–46], procedures based on false-positive control are often underpowered in NGS studies involving rare variants (as illustrated in Fig 1).
%     In NGS studies with rare variants, the Signals region often degenerates due to extremely low MAF and high dimensionality.
%
% GWAS arrays don't tag rare variants very well:
% Also: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3830981/
% When the allele frequencies of two loci are very different, the r2 will never
% be very large. To see this, let's assume pA<<PB and 1-pA≈1. Then the maximum
% r2≈pA/pB*(1-pB), which is <<1 since PA is very small compared to pB. This
% indicates that causal rare variants are mostly likely to be missed in GWAS for
% single marker tests, since GWAS chips are designed to include predominantly
% common variants (e.g. MAF>0.05).
%
% Therefore, GWASs are by design powered to detect association with causal variants that are relatively common in the population.

% NOTE: a second approach to heritability estimation is linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression.
%
\todo{CUT: Missing heritability}
% \1 Missing heritability refers to the observation that SNP-based heritability estimates from \gls{GWAS} fall short of additive (narrow-sense) heritability estimates from traditional quantitative methods such as twin studies.
% Perhaps unsurprisingly, it has been hypothesised that the remaining heritability lies in variants that can not be assessed by \gls{GWAS} due to rarity or small effect.
% A classic example is the heritability of human height, estimated at 80\% by twin studies \autocite{maher2008PersonalGenomesCase},
% where considering only significant associations from \gls{GWAS} explains 5\% \autocite{maher2008PersonalGenomesCase}.
% Consideration of all common variants using mixed models (\software{GCTA}) increases the estimate to 45\% \autocite{yang2010CommonSNPsExplain},
% Recent work (\software{GREML-WGS}) suggests the full estimate of 80\% might be recoverable by also including rare and poorly tagged variants measured by \gls{WGS} \autocite{wainschtein2019RecoveryTraitHeritability}.

\todo{CUT: WGS/WES migitates the coverage bias of GWAS towards known variation.}
% \1 WES/WGS is a trade-off between sample size and genomic coverage
%     \2 Allows tdiscovery and association with rare and novel variation, including structural variants.
%     \2 "In addition, other genome-wide scans, such as WES and WGS studies, allow testing for a burden of rare variants across shared functional units (e.g., genes) in a way that is not accessible to GWASs."
% \1 WES (covers about 40Mbp of the genome)
%     \2 covers more of the genome than GWAS
%     \2 but lower n, so lower power to do single variant associations

\subsection{From locus to variant: fine-mapping}

\1 By design, a significantly-associated variant from a \gls{GWAS} needs not be a variant that causally affects the trait, and may only tag a causal variant.
    \2 Fine-mapping is the process of determining which of the many correlated variants at a \gls{GWAS} locus are causal.
    \2 The power to separate causal and tag variants then depends on \gls{LD} and sample size \autocite{visscher201710YearsGWAS}.
    \2 State-of-the-art methods provide Bayesian posterior probabilities that associated variants are causal given the \gls{LD} structure of the region, and can consider the presence of multiple causal variants at the same locus \autocite{schaid2018GenomewideAssociationsCandidate}.
    \2 Naturally, these methods assign probabilities assuming the causal variant is in the set of variants tested.
    \2 The causal variant must either be genotyped or imputed denser genotyping e.g. by WGS, and larger imputation panels will help.

    Using genetic data to strengthen causal inference in observational research
    Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) integrating GWAS and eQTLs data have been proposed to unravel gene–trait associations7,9,10. However, although these studies aim to identify genes whose (genetically predicted) expression is significantly associated to complex traits, they do not aim to estimate the strength of the causal effect and are unable to distinguish causation from horizontal pleiotropy (i.e., when a genetic variant influences multiple phenotypes independently). For this reason, we rather chose to apply a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to estimate the causal effect of gene expression on complex traits.

    Given the genetic control of the healthy immune system, one can hypothesise that immune response to challenge may also be influenced by genetic factors.

% An increasingly popular approach to identifying genetic factorsinfluencing
% the interindividual variation in immune response is tomap expression
% quantitative trait loci (eQTLs)—variants thatassociate  with  gene
% expression—and  to  identify  so-calledresponse  eQTLs  (reQTLs)  where  the
% eQTL  effect  differsbetween immune stimuli. Such genetic variants can impact
% thetranscriptional response to infection, and also represent geneticeffects
% that are modified by the infectious environment viagene-by-environment
% interactions. We and other groups havepreviously published reQTL studies of
% stimulated immune cellsand demonstrated that the effects of a genetic variant
% ongene expression are highly context-specific and informativefor disease6–11.

The majority of response eQTL mapping experiments to date have been conducted \textit{in vitro}, where one can precisely adjust both the length and intensity of stimulation.
Environmental variables including cell type composition or tissue type that are expected to interact with the eQTL effect and may affect the interaction effect with stimulation can be controlled.
The choice of experiment system and stimulation can also be hypothesis-driven, for example, if certain tissues are expected to be more relevant for a specific disease. 
\todo{add more pros for in vitro reQTLs here, and find citations}.

One of the first studies to perform \gls{reQTL} mapping for an immune stimulation was \autocite{barreiro2012DecipheringGeneticArchitecture}, where eQTLs were mapped separately in monocyte-derived dendritic cells before and after 18h infection with \textit{Mycobacterium tuberculosis}.
reQTLs were detected for 198 genes, 102 specific to the uninfected state, and 96 specific to the infected state. 
These reQTLs were enriched for GWAS SNPs associated with host susceptibility to tuberculosis; this was not observed for eQTLs that were not reQTLs.

Since then, \textit{in vitro} immune reQTL studies have been conducted for a variety of experimental systems (e.g. primary CD14+ monocytes\autocite{fairfax2014InnateImmuneActivity}) and stimulations (IFN$\gamma$ and LPS\autocite{fairfax2014GeneticsGeneExpression}).

Take home messages:
- reQTLs develop trans-effects on stimulation \autocite{fairfax2014InnateImmuneActivity}
Overall, as the number of experimental systems and stimulations increases, large number of eQTLs are only detected.

\subsection{Immune response to vaccination is a complex trait}

Vaccination has enormous impact on global health [10.1098/rstb.2013.0433].

Vaccines stimulate the immune system with pathogen-derived antigens to induce effector responses (primarily antigen-specific antibodies) and immunological memory against the pathogen itself.
These effector responses are then be rapidly reactivated in cases of future exposure to the pathogen, mediating long-term protection.

    Review of systems vaccinology (pull out of self\_viva\_copypasta)
    These systems vaccinology studies often consider longitudinal measurements of the transcriptomic, cellular, cytokine, and antibody immune responses following vaccination[Vaccinology in the era of high-throughput biology.].

    Systems vaccinology is the application of -omics technologies to provide a systems-level characterisation of the human immune system after vaccine-perturbation.
    Measurements are taken at multiple molecular levels (e.g. genome, transcriptome, proteome), and molecular signatures that correlate with and predict vaccine-induced immunity are identified [http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2014.0146].
    \todo{define what a signature is}
    Systems vaccinology has been successfully applied to a variety of licensed vaccines [yellow fever, influenza], and also to vaccine candidates against [HIV, malaria], resulting in the identification of early transcriptomic signatures that predict vaccine-induced antibody responses.
