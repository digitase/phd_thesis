\chapter{Response to live attenuated rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix) in Vietnamese infants}

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{The genetics of vaccine response in early life}

\subsection{Rotavirus and rotarix in Vietnam}

\subsection{Known factors that affect rotavirus vaccine efficacy}

\section{Methods}

\subsection{RNA-seq data generation}

Stranded RNAseq AUTO with Globin Depletion (>47 samples) uses the NEB Ultra
II directional RNA library kit for the poly(A) pulldown, fragmentation, 1st and
2nd strand synthesis and the flowing cDNA library prep (with some minor tweaks
e.g. at during the PCR we use kapa HiFi not NEB's Q5 polymerase). Between the
poly (A) pulldown and the fragmentation we use a kapa globin depletion kit
(it's very similar to their riboerase kit but the rRNA probes are swapped for
globin ones).

\subsection{Genotyping}

\section{Results}

Transcriptomic response to rotavirus vaccination (pre- vs. post-, prime vs. boost dose, responders vs. non-responders)

Genetic contribution to transcriptomic response

\section{Discussion}
